The gameplay is fast paced, creative and diverse, the character design is phenomenal, most of the heroes look fantastic, the maps look gorgeous, so many hidden details everywhere, overall I can safely say that this is an amazing game.

But what doesn't make it a perfect game is the horrible matchmaking, the lack of gamemodes and the atrocious balancing. It's a shame that the game got abandoned all of a sudden because fortunately its flaws can be fixed as times goes by.

It's still a very enjoyable experience, and I'm glad I didn't miss out on it, one of my favorite Online Multiplayer games for sure.

I get tired of it, but I always go back to playing it.
But the game is ruined completely by it's completely rigged and bad matchmaking system. The matchmaking system forces you to lose, if you are doing too good. This is not only a theory - this happens everytime. If you got on a winstreak and play really good, let's say you get 9 wins and 1 loss the last 10 games - the matchmaking system will put you all of sudden with team-mates who are WAY below your level and your opposing teams level to make you lose.
This happens every single time. All of a sudden you get a Reinhardt who don't know how to position, and charges in before the team can group and dies. I'm usually around 2800-3100 range.

The counter argument i've seen is ""but duh, the proos.. the 0.00001% can climb, so it's not the system dude. Right.. that is correct the 0.0000.1 % of the best players can climb no matter what, cause even in a bad matchup they are so incredibly good it doesn't matter. They are worth those other 4 people who are much worse. But for a normal human - like me and many others - this system is making you lose on purpose and there is almost nothing you can do and that is superfrustrating.

I'm not sure why they do this, if it's to keep you in the game longer to buy boxes or whatever. But I recon it has some intent like that. It's really sad seing them having this anti-player system purposely.

The second bad thing is they allow duos and teams in Solo-queue, this is also ruining the game for people like me who mostly play solo. The better DUO always wins (because they have much better cordination) and if they don't they are usually toxic. So they force you to play with a hopeless game or toxic people.

The third bad thing with the game is that they never release anything new anymore. They are making an ""Overwatch 2"" which never comes out...  im not sure what they're thinking - but I again knowing ""Blizzard"" (which is really just a bunch of new employees calling themselves Blizzard, all the real devs have left pretty much), it's probably because of some greedy reason. They are probably figuring out a way to monetize the game even more.

Otherwise - awsome game. For the gameplay alone, the graphics, optimization etc, style. Everything like that is great. Sad it's ruined by this fact.… Expand"

The game is much more enjoyable if you play with people you know! This is what the game was designed for. Playing with strangers can be fun.. but it can at times also be horrible. Absolutely horrible

The matchmaking system is the worst in any competitive game I have played, and those are quite a lot since I've been gaming for over 25 years. There are many conspiracy theories (50% win rate algorithms, intermittent reinforcement and so on). Never before have I rolled so many people, and been rolled so many times. Also a lot of smurfs in the game, some of them my friends (who have played since release and have many accounts, but are actually grandmaster/masters/high diamond). This sucks for people who face them.

All in all, a good game, that has issues, and a really missed opportunity from Blizzard. The playerbase has dropped significantly from a few years ago, and many feel the game is neglected by Blizzard, who are putting their efforts into overwatch 2.

Could have been a 10/10, in it's current state it's a 7-8/10. Hoping some Microsoft direction and money can fix it, and that Overwatch 2 is a success xD… Expand"

- i don't like competitive tickets, reputation level - they are little wrong
- every game should have some info - for example - unwinnable game or evening unwinnable game

Tank, support and damage. This system was forced some time ago into a 2/2/2 system. 2 tanks, 2 healers and 2 damage. Before it was that you could pick any. This system was even pushed onto casual modes. This leads to high queue times as a damage while tanks and supports got a near instant queue. Blizzard has repeated the same mistake they have done in World of Warcraft. The reason for this system was because they could not balance around a specific strategy called ""goats"".

Out of these 32 characters, only a couple of them are viable if you want to win. Especially in ranked. Blizzard managed to bring imbalance into such as small number of available heroes to play. The damage role has 17 heroes to play. Out of these 17 only a handful are viable to play. 7 tanks, 3 are viable at best, 2 at worst. 6 support characters, 3 are viable if you play a high rank, 2 are viable if you don't. The hero balance is awful. If you don't have 2 viable heroes but the other team got them? That's a lost game. Only 32 characters and they managed to have an insane imbalance. Tanks are not very much played because the ones that are viable are simply not fun if you have to play them every single game to win.

There hasn't been any new content for the last 2 or so years as Blizzard works on OverWatch 2. There hasn't been any news about it or anything really. But Blizzard abandoned OverWatch as a game. Seemingly OverWatch 2 is OverWatch but with an added PvE mode. Nobody knows what the developers are doing at this point.

The maps are ok. I am just wondering how nobody ever at the development team stopped for a moment on Horizon Lunar Colony and Paris and went ""Maybe this is design wise not a good choice"". These two maps are the worst and many people skip them. They were removed from competitive games because they are that terrible. The latest added map was a deathmatch map for reasons beyond mortal understanding. Nobody plays deathmatch.

The report system is automated and stack based. Not reviewed by any customer service, so pretty worthless. The message that pops up when you report someone that you report them to ""the Blizzard customer service"" is a straight up lie.

Loot boxes are terrible and should be banned. Not exception from this game for it.

The recent experimental build was great because it came from actual players of the game. This company has people employed for the balance and lore. We have not gotten any significant lore (people ask for an extension of Sigmas lore since ages) since forever and lore additions itself are very rare. The writers are paid to do nothing, same for the balance guys. What a dream job these lazy developers must have.

There was some weird update where they removed all regions, which led to insanely high pings because you were put into servers far away. Since this update my average ping is around 10 higher. Occasionally I am still getting thrown onto NA servers while being in Europe. The matchmaking system has been awful since then too.

The game itself is great if you jump into it for a few rounds as a casual but if you expect anything more then you will be in for a disappointment. This game is good to play a couple of rounds and then stop, otherwise you will notice the heavy flaws very fast. Blizzard completely lost the hype of the game. If you want a better experience play Paladins.

I give it a 5 because it's fun if you don't think about it too much, casuals can still enjoy it and it atleast gets new skins for events. But a lot of points are removed because Blizzard gave up on this game. It seems like they gave up on ALL their games. A shame really because the game could be much more.… Expand"

There are too many controls for a simple shooter game, the tutorial doesn't teach anything properly and the games we play while waiting for an online game ends abruptly without giving any indication that there was a time limit the whole time. Every single character has a different move set, which is great, except, there are too many characters. Mastering all the characters is hard, especially considering you can pick only those characters that have not already been taken.

The biggest problem probably comes from its provider. Battle.net is a trashy platform that makes the PC run very slowly. This in turn makes the game constantly drop the frame rate and there are no settings to stop it from happening (it happens even in the lowest graphic settings). And this in turn makes aiming super difficult. By the time I reach my crosshair at the enemy, they have already taken me down.

The lore given to the game is also very nice. Every character has a short based on them. It's nice to see how much depth they have given every character. Just seeing the characters itself makes it look interesting - a girl with a robot, a gorilla, a hamster, an Indian demigoddess etc. You know you're in for a good time when you have characters like these.

The TL:DR is - I would be lying if I said the game hasn't given me good memories but frankly I can count the times I closed the game in a good mood on my fingers. The simple truth to why the game leaves a sour taste in many people's mouths, as well as mine, is that it's just not really an FPS. The marketing and surface-level gameplay make it out to be just that, but I would argue the game possesses much more MOBA elements rather than FPS ones. Sure, you shoot guns and the game is first-person but the focus is more on team fights, and getting something done by yourself is a rare occurrence, much rarer if you stick with the game and actually climb the ladder. Frankly, no other game is similar to Overwatch in that aspect and a large portion of the community, as well as the balancing team really, can't handle such an innovative concept, which results in the infamous toxic players. You'd think there would be some compensation in terms of varying game modes but there is just one - a competitive mode. Even that mode is barely playable due to the constant smurfing as blizzard has put 0 effort in trying to put a stop to it, with many signed players openly smurfing on streams. ""Ah, but what if I play with 5 of my mates"", you would be matched against another 6 stack with at least 1 being a booster/smurf. ""At least the lore is good and the characters are interesting"" you might have heard but the lore consists of 5 animated shorts and 10 comic books. Even so, all of them are build-up with none actually attempting to progress the story in any way.

The standard gameplay consists of two 6-player teams playing an objective, like holding a control point or pushing a payload. It is set in a first person shooter setting.

The main excitement about Overwatch is the huge gallery of heroes. In contrast to traditional shooters, the main emphasis in Overwatch in addition to the gunplay are the special abilities of the characters. No one hero plays out the same as another one and trying out different heroes and their respective playstyle is fundamentally fun, there is no doubt about that.

However, like most online matchmaking games with emphasis on diverse abilities, Overwatch particularly suffers balancing issues resulting in stale meta games and frequent occurences of games where one team gets ""steam rolled"".

At worst, those games can be extremely frustrating and make you quit the game for a while, but you'll eventually come back for it, because when it comes down for it, it is a good game. The games, that are balanced and where you can say ""gg, close"" at the end even if you lost the match bring a certain type of satisfaction, which will make you come back to this game, even if you run the risk to get a game where your team gets absolutely steam rolled.

With how the dev team handles the game, I am convinced they care about their game, making frequent updates to the game to (sometimes desperately) ensure a balanced experience, which in my opninion probably will never happen because there are simply too many heroes with too diverse and powerful abilities and they keep pumping out new heroes all the time.

In short: A fun hero shooter with some balancing issues which is fun to play once in a while.

PS: I disagree with Metacritic saying a 7/10 is ""Mixed"", I still think this game is positive, but if I could give it a rating out of 5 stars, I wouldn't give it 4.
