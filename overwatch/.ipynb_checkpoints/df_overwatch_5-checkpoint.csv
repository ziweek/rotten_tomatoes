El juego es bueno, e incluso visualmente y conceptualmente resulta increíblemente bueno. Los controles en PC son sólidos y fáciles de comprender y controlar. Creo los mayores problemas del juego surgen gracias a la toxica comunidad que se ha formado al rededor de este, la que realmente afecta mucho la experiencia del multi-jugador, esto incluye a la gente toxica y a los molestos hackers. A pesar de esto se pueden encontrar partidas buenas, y gracias a la variedad de servidores puedes evitar esas molestas experiencias, aunque aún así creo debe haber más control y mas comunicación con los usuarios de parte de Blizzard.… Expand"

Matchmaking isA technically perfect title, with astonishing graphics, optimized performances and nice menu navigation.
It has very well designed character, mixing togheder skills taken from TF2 and balancing them between characters.

That said, even if it's an incredibly well developed and maintained title, it has something that goes wrong when talking about the fun that it gives.
Matchmaking is slow (sometimes it reachs 5-6 minutes to find a match in Europe, than after the match you have to wait again), unconsistent and the number of concurrent players is far from being the ""40 million"" they advertise so much.

The hero skill based gameplay, even if it's almost balanced after lots of update, it's far from being a competitive style of game, on wich they push so much: it's a slot machine team game, where the only thing that matter is not shooting but using nicely your skill and, most of all, the ultimate, the unpredictable gamechanging factor that ruins everything. I know it's a cool idea, but it's not meant to be done for competitive and fair kind of games.
The most frustrating thing is that a match is mostly based on shield heroes and support ones. Some of those last ones are, also, a lot overpowered and nothing has been made to balance them. Even if a support should be used aggressively, you should not design a character that does area heal, has a shield, has stun and does a lot of melee damage.
It also seems like the game want to please everyone, giving medals and highlight randomly, also to very bad players during the match without reason.

The community is sometimes toxic, sometimes weeaboo, sometimes Brizard's fans. I'm not saying it's always that way, but during my hours of gameplay I've got some encounters like that.
The undoubted overrating behaviour arround this title seems in part caused from this very last part of the community.
Also it's true what they say: if you are solo or you are in a team but with very incompetent friends, don't think the matchmaking is gonna give you match based on your overall skill level.

I won't talk (and considering in the score that I've given) about the lore that is pretty cheap both in narration and articulation, since it has nothing to do with the gameplay.

Lastly, the incredible lack of maps and modes. Heroes are enough, skins and collectibles also, but stuff that regards gameplay is in miserable quantity for a paid online-only title.… Expand"

If I can describe my entire experience of playing Overwatch in one word, it would be  - frustrating.

I have been met with immediate hatred, blaming, random cursing, nothing to even slightly resemble a good time. And""Sometimes I'm not sure why do I even bother ..""

If I can describe my entire experience of playing Overwatch in one word, it would be  - frustrating. Upon playing your first match, you do not feel as if you are entering a video game, but opening the gates of hell instead. I have been met with immediate hatred, blaming, random cursing, nothing to even slightly resemble a good time. And this is just the beginning. The main problem of Overwatch is that it is a competitive shooter that relies way too much on team play, and personal skill means nothing on its own. Obviously, it is greatly important how good you are at the game, but you cannot do anything on your own even if you are the best player out there. The team setup has to be well-thought, with some hero combinations being clearly more prone to success than others, but ironically nobody really cares. Playing in a team that picks 5 dps characters and you play the only support is not uncommon, but the funny thing is that most of these players love to blame somebody else for their own selfishness. It feels as if they lose intentionally so that they can blame, fight and argue with somebody.

Another problem that only fuels the previously mentioned fault of the game is the competitive matchmaking system. New solo players of skill must get ready for the so-called ELO hell. The system matches you against either worse or better players, so that you can get your dose of winning, however when the system decides it is time for you to lose, it is going to pair you with clearly worse players so that you have no chance (just check the stats!). For example, sometimes you are going to play against a team of a higher rank, but being matched with people that have much lower stats than you.  Overall it feels that the matchmaking system has been designed to artificially pull you down the ladder so that it would take you more time to climb, meaning more money for the company.... A very bad money-grabbing practice.

The third problem of the game is that it suffers from a lot of balance issues, with some characters being much stronger than others. This is an issue that is practically unsolvable, considering the different roles and skills each character has. As a player, you get adjusted to how everything works, but you notice some character interactions being unfair, such as some characters being unable to make any dps to a tank, or others instakill a healer. Character redesigns do not fix the real problem, sadly.

But not everything is bad stuff.. All the characters have been designed very well, with attention to details of their personality, skill, attitude, etc.. The game levels are beautiful, vibrant and open to different scenarios, however, there are not nearly enough. The game has been programmed and polished very well, being able to work on older hardware, too. The fast pace of the action has been captured quite well, with the right design choices holding everything well together.

All in all, Overwatch most definitely is not a bad game, however, it suffers from the same problems other Blizzard games have - greed. My observations lead me to believe that most of the player frustration comes from the horrible matchmaking that intentionally disrespects the solo player.… Expand"

18,DKR,"May 25, 2018",6,"At first, I feel privileged to be the first to make a thoughtful, honest review instead of ""omg its tf2"" and ""omg cancer community!1!""

You can tell they played every video game they couldAt first, I feel privileged to be the first to make a thoughtful, honest review instead of ""omg its tf2"" and ""omg cancer community!1!""

Bliz has taken the title belt over every genre it's entered: MMO, FPS, RTS, ARPG,...ok HOTS was pretty bad, but point is they're no pushovers of game developing, and Overwatch truly is revolutionary. You can tell they played every video game they could to extract every good idea for gameplay possible and - frankly - crafted an FPS to such perfection that OW will be the standard of FPS for rest of time in terms of gameplay/character design, map design, voice work, music composition, commendably balanced heroes, beautiful graphics, even going PC (ie a lesbian hero, a bisexual hero, or buff chick and chunky chick for the feminists, or robots that are portrayed as an oppressed minority [I can see the others, but racism against robots? really?] ) just about everything in OW is polished to a shiny sheen. So, why the low score?

It isn't evolving. It could be argued that Bliz made a game so perfect that it has nowhere to go, but there is still this looming void about the game as the years pass (even bliz said ""here comes next comp season. see you there._. ). TF2 introduced new modes, new weapons which allowed alternate play styles, many, many new maps, and it's personality was one-of-a-kind with a charm that never went away. OW has given little new content save for an occasional map, or a new hero who's balancing is all over the place (sombra sucked @1st, ana was a god @1st, Fist either kills everything or dies instantly, and Moira is f**ing INSANE) or taking some casual mode and putting COMP in front if it i.e. comp FFA/soccer. The flow of content is slow and anti climactic.

2nd reason is the game's lore is absolute garbage. The game has no driving narrative. Every hero's story is ""everyone thought they died...BUT THEY CAME BACK WITH VIDEO GAEEM PWERRZZ!!""
As is trendy nowadays, everyone has 0 development. None. It's like Bliz made a 20 part book series that all had 1 chapter. It's hard to view the heroes as...well heroes, bc they don't fight anything. Who is the enemy? Why do they exist? Why are they fighting? To kick a soda machine's a** in Japan?

C'mon, we all know the real reason why this is. If you want a plot to be interesting, characters have to struggle, suffer, discuss morality, philosophy, justice vs vengeance, mercy or execution, 2nd chance or judgement, who is the hero and who is the villain, who are you rooting for/against? Not only would this take time and *cough* talent, but calling something ""evil"" might offend someone, so everyone's motivation is brushed into a cloud of uncertainty, pretty graphics, and shiny, purple booties. After all, WHO ARE YOU TO SAY WHATS RIGHT OR WRONG! CHECK UR PRIVILEGE BRO! UR JUST (shaming buzzword here).

The balancing isn't perfect either. Junkrat, Phara, and Widow leave a warpath to the objectives bc they have little counterplay when used properly. Phara 2 shots her own counters & 90% of the OW cast can't even engage her bc her mobility and flight which render her unkillable, Rat can blindly spam to f*ing murder teams by himself, and accurate Widow's are 1man armies while no one plays Report Torb.

Speaking of reports, Bliz still has their bs report system. Problem is, you can get reported for ""abusive language"" for playing Torb. I made a sarcastic, unoffensive comment in General Chat, and saw a 3 month silence. Should I even be shocked anymore? The first month I played OW, I didn't talk, and weekly i still got emails from Bliz telling me to tone down the abuse. Now I'm getting reported for not communicating, and paragraphs of ""teamwork"" and ""this is why you're bronze"" sermons.

Which brings me to my final beef with OW: the community. No, they're not the worst ever. Honestly, I'd say this is the least toxic & coolest community I've seen in 20 years of online gaming, so what's so bad? Even here, you can see ""cancerous community"" popup in all of the neg reviews. What. a bunch. of babies. Try LoL. You kids don't know the meaning of ""cancer"", but bc the squeaky wheel was so loud, Bliz made their dumb*ss report system so they can PR about the number of punished accounts.

I can't take it anymore. When it comes to gameplay, they are so. f*ing. stupid. Leave it to our favorite collective of idiots to make ""GROUP, WALK TO SQUARE, PUSH Q"" impossibly difficult. I don't mean losing, I mean being completely and utterly shut down. All you can do is kick back in your lawn chair and laugh at the calamity. The enemy is sooo good. Tanks absorbing damage, dps kicking ass, present healers, great ultimate usage, great focus, and no matter how much I bomb my elo, they always have a badass sniper that doesn't miss a headshot. You're team has 6 wandering DPS that only exist as Dabacabb montage fodder leaving you - as 1 player - defenseless.

Graphically the game looks really nice, but highly stylized. Whether you'll like it or not is up to personal opinion.
The game is fairly well polished and optimized, but can be pretty glitchy at times.
The game has quite a few characters by now, which promotes varied gameplay, but unfortunately Blizzard is atrociously slow at balancing them. After reworks or new characters are added, it takes months for them to become balanced. Brigitte is the newest example of this, the character is broken af and has caused many tank mains (myself included) to stray away from tanking because she can screw them over without even needing to touch the keyboard.
Competitive in Overwatch isn't particularly good (I personally loathe it). There's no form of role queuing, so you often end up with with 3-4 DPS mains (since DPS players make up the vast majority of the playerbase).
Overwatch has annual events where you can unlock limited time cosmetics by playing or buying loot boxes, they also usually feature special arcade modes.
Overwatch has some pretty nice social features, there's both voice and text chat (the text chat is only available on PC though), and you can easily stay in touch with people you meet outside of the game as well due to the social features of the launcher.

Regardless of my many gripes with this game, I've come to love it due to the varied gameplay and memorable characters, and I would highly recommend trying it out.… Expand"

Almost every match is a complete washout for one side or the other, depending on whether the MM has decided you should win or lose. New players, prepare your anus because the matchmaking only (allegedly) tries to match aggregate skill on the two teams. That means that a bad player can and WILL get thrown in a match where almost everyone is much better as long as the magic algorithm thinks that the approximate team skill levels are balanced. Leaving aside the point I made above that matches are almost always garbage in solo-queue, even a near even match between teams will be a complete joyless pain if you are just fodder for the enemy team, and that's what is going on. Try logging on to some of the modes anywhere after about 8pm and watch what you'll get- one team around level 100 (or less) each against 3-5 people above 400lvls of experience. Pre-made teams against randoms. It's not a gg. So what I said before about matching the average skill of a team is BS, they don't even come close.

It would be great if the vaunted ""critic reviews"" actually looked at things like matchmaking.

((Oh, and if you encounter the same jack@ss again and again griefing his own team, you can't do anything about it because they took out the ""avoid player"" button because toxic AHs were upset that no one wanted to play with them. The excuse is that ""good players were being avoided because no one wanted to get beaten by them"" but the SENSIBLE solution would have been to make ""avoid this player"" avoid having him on YOUR team. But Blizzard is either lazy, stupid, or loves to keep their games full of idiots griefing each other. Is mei walling his own team? How about teleporters that lead off cliffs?)) see below

EDIT 3/25/18: Overwatch has now implemented a feature that allows you to avoid players on your team, just as many have suggested. HOWEVER, they limit you to two people. Two people out of how many players? And it lasts only 7 days. in the announcement they posted they said they are going to look at queue times and might increase the number. Hopefully they will increase it.

And unfortunately there is no story, no plot, no solo or co-op play of any relevance so if you are put off by the crap matches you get, there is no point in playing. Really, the only way to play this game and have any fun is with multiple friends- the more the better so that you can defeat Blizzard's garbage matchmaking. But why give blizzard money for their lazy practices?

There isn't a problem of hackers, but I've seen people completely pubstomp games with 50+ eliminations, usually as reaper, genji or bastion. Bastion isn't OP, it's that he's easy to play and the skill level required to beat him is a bit more substantial than the skill required to play him. Supports are well done, surprisingly. Most of them feel balanced, with a good skill ceiling availible for ambitous players. defense heroes are alright. Bit dull overall, with mei being an exception. I'm seeing way too many ultimates though, and unfortunately I see so many more offensive ones it's usually normal to see entire teams getting wiped out by 3 simultaneous ultimates. while mercy might only pop her ult once per round. Supports aren't building their ults fast enough. Tanks are surprisngly fun, with a lot of tactics involved other than running straight into enemy fire.
Graphically i'm split. It looks great, with animation-like models and great environments. The optmization is also really good, running on lower end machines as well. My main problem is that a lot of the effects are too jarring. The screen can easily be filled with all sorts of visual effects, making it impossible to see what's happening.
Mechanically it's good. The game modes are fair, with good amounts of opprunity on both sides for most games. I will say that payload maps need a rework. I'm seeing way too many bottlenecks where the game just freezes there until 3 or 4 ults are popped.Most maps are fine. None of them are very good though. It would pay to look at other games that have done maps well before. Please fix the jump animations. They make me feel terrible, like they have bobble heads or rigid spines.
With friends? This game is amazing. The atmosphere the game creates is great. However I will say that the servers aren't great, so if some friends aren't in the same country, let alone region, I'd advise against playing with them.
the music is ok. Honestly i thought Blizzard could do better but it's fine. it works and the tension is there near the end of the rounds. but it's bland compared to the overall theme of the game.
Customization is great. Lots of taunts, voice clips, alternate costumes and sprays, although a good amount of the skins are just different colour schemes. The voice acting is superb, especially when the characters talk to each other during the preparation period.
Almost no community made items though. no private servers or custom maps or private matches. A bit disappointed but really I've been spoilt by Valve letting me host whatever i want. L4D2, CSGO and TF2 al have a thriving community creating new stuff. Blizzard could release an Asset maker for us. That'd be fun.
It's fun. There's competitive. There are few hackers. Graphically and stylistically it's great.
But this score is how much i enjoyed it.
And I think it's a great game. I  might update my score after more content is released but right now not much is making me go ""Hey I want to go back to Overwatch"" and play more of it. It's hella fun, and when there's synergy, it works. But most of the time it's as if I've already played this before. i don't know whether the amount of content coming is worth staying on for, or Blizzard is just gonna take the SFV route and delay content but 30 quid isn't getting me much. I look forward to seeing what Blizzard does and whether it updates my score but a 7 is what I think it's worth.
EDIT 2018
The game has, as i had hoped, significant content patches with new maps n heroes. I can now say you can easily justify the price tag the game has.  However, problems are still there, and I will talk about how it can still improve.
my initial review in 2016 said that a lot of the mechanics were good. I feel that it has only improved,with blizzard slowly tuning it so that the online feel is much more cohesive. Each hero feels a bit more consistent, with viability and strategy matching the map and skills you're on. i also appreciate the continued optimization. It still runs beautifully and i think that it does stand head and shoulders with DOOM/Warframe as one of the best running games you can get. Blizzard also gets a thumbs up for allowing server browser, better custom modes, arcade modes. These are the things that every multiplayer shooter should have and I'm glad that these features are now available. Servers are better, though i still recommend only playing with friends in the same region.
However, i still have a few problems. Toxic players are part of any online game, but dealing with people who queue together is a hassle and I leave games to avoid toxic groups. The graphics are still far too flashy, making it difficult to pinpoint targets.… Expand"

The leveling up is pointless too as you just get appearance packs. You don't actually get to customize your load-out or anything like you can with Team Fortress.

I think I'll be trying out Battleborn again once the majority of the technical issues have been fixed. Right now I believe Overwatch is absolutely not worth the asking price and you should wait unless competitive shooters are really your thing. Overwatch doesn't try to do anything innovative or different for that matter compared to similar objective based shooters.

Is it fun? Yes, when your team is playing with the correct heroes.
The caveat: You will be utterly annihilated if just one or two people from your team play the wrong characters.

It's a very unbalanced game by design it seems, I can see what Blizzard were going for but in practice matches simply revolve around playing the correct character more than actually playing well. Heroes which aren't defenders cannot do much good on their own which is to be expected but requires complete team co-operation which is an unrealistic expectation unless you're playing with friends.

I don't recommend this game unless you have friends you're willing to play and co-operate with.… Expand"

I am sad to give this Game such a Low Score as I had my hopes up high for this FPS.

Blizzard is generally a company with excellent Games and outstanding quality, however Overwatch is no such thing.

Originally Overwatch was a first person MOBA Game that required team play and team communication to win. With different Heroes being good at different Things in their own Way. This used to be its Soul, which sadly has been completely destroyed.

Quick Play is now just a mode for you to try out heroes and get lucky. Arcade surprisingly is where people actually try and win, because each third win will get you a lootbox, for up to 3 Lootboxes.

Competitive Mode is completely destroyed, thanks to smurfs and Boosters. You can go and google ""overwatch boosting"" and find millions of people that boost you up to any rank you want via their smurf accounts. This is especially frustrating when you try and want to get better in the game by ranking up. To explain this a little bit better this is the current state:
Grandmasters & Master cant connect to anybody that isnt within 500SR Range, however if they make a new account they can play with anybody they want and stomp any SR below them.

This Game does not require team play anymore, thanks to heroes being nerfed to either being unplayable or buffed to do the max dps possible (yes even the medics). Whats the point in taking Widowmaker a defense hero on defense? If Ana the medic sniper can do more Damage.

The Game is not only incredibly unbalanced it is also rather unfair, especially when it comes to matchmaking.

As long as smurfes arent banned from the Game the Competitive Mode will never work correctly.

It seems Overwatchs Priority lays on one thing and one thing only, Lootboxes & Money. As they showed recently by adding a new currency you can only get by paying real money. Microstransactions in a 60€ Game is absolutely disgusting.

So is Overwatch recommandable? Not at all, Overwatch has lost its Soul and its Charm. The Developer Team has been arguing within development and it shows its lack of love towards the game. Heroes have been completely rehauled making the game even more unbalanced then it was before.

If it doesnt speak in Dollar Signs Overwatch does not care what you have to say. When they say they listen to the community, they mean we listen to the 1 percent of streamers and League players.

Overwatch is a take on the FPS genre create by Blizzard. It is meant to give a fast, exciting, and teamwork orientated environment. However, this review is on my experiences with the game, tossed in with very personal opinions. This 'rant' (you can say) is for a smaller and fresh audience to the fps genre (Like I am).

This game has a learning curve that is not present with other non-fps games (Well, obviously, let me touch on it a bit more). If you are new on the fps genre, you are probably aren't aware of the most basic (And in my case, hard to learn) fundamentals of fps games. Checking your flanks, having steady aim, strafing, all while the game is so fast-paced, that you forget about it (or have difficulty, I was on a controller, I rather prefer keyboard). This can lead to other fps veterans to kill you on the spot with your predictable movements. Things like this can affect your mind, while getting frustrated on why it isn't working out.

Another aspect I want to dig into is the mental strength you require. If you are starting this game as your first fps, you have a massive cliff to climb. While you struggle with the basics, you are, to say it bluntly, a very likely burden for your team. This leads to losing, which happens a lot when starting, possibly flattening your confidence. This can lead to negative emotions.

Lastly, frustratingly playing the game with no visible enjoyment. Play this as your first FPS game can be like dealing with an annoying associate of yours. You can do so much, then before you know it, it can lead to a severely toxic atmosphere. This was me dealing with it myself (along with others playing the game).

Overall, Overwatch is a game that was born from an idea from Blizzard. It can be a hard and frustrating experience. Don't get this wrong, at times it is a rather fun game; it is just very difficult to squeeze out its enjoy-ability in the over-competitive, skill-lacking mindset of people like me.

Я играю в OW уже почти 2 года, то есть с его релиза (сделал предзаказ). За это время много чего поменялось: добавили новые карты, персонажей, разные облики, правили баланс (хоть и не всегда удачно). Также есть полно отличных короткометражек и официальных комиксов по игре, рекомендую их почитать! Играю на ранге ""Алмаз"" начиная со второго сезона. Могу с уверенностью сказать, что обычно негативные отзывы оставляют, так сказать, нубы. То есть они ноют потому, что не разобрались в механике игры или не умеют контрить определённых героев, из-за чего появляется их любимый дисбаланс. Кстати, негативных людей на низких рангах тоже намного больше.

Сейчас в игре почти всё идеально, но как и большинство онлайн игр она бывает сильно выводит из себя, из-за чего хочется винить игру, а не свой скилл или везение.

Единственные проблемы: бан за мейнерство, даже если ты играешь хорошо и, пожалуй, небольшой дисбаланс отдельных героев. Но так как меня эти проблемы не затронули, то я ставлю 10/10.

However, the reality was disappointing.
- This is so called ""team"" game where you can not see your (or anyone's else) team-related performance. If something goes wrong, you can only make wild guesses. We have completely useless and misguiding medals instead, which tell nothing about teamplay or team contribution or team needs at current moment.
- Blizzard promised great ""casual-competitive"" gameplay, but solo queue competitive is abysmal. Every third game is won or lost due to reasons-related-to-ONE-player (someone is a troll and decided to throw a game, someone is 4000-rating genji main in 3100 game and just eliminates opposing team, someone is unlucky to have crappy ISP and disconnects midgame, someone is that special person who plays ONLY Torb/Widow/Hanzo, etc, etc - you can't do anything in these cases to change the outcome). The only way would be to find your own 6-10-20 man team of similar skill & mindset; but that is completely opposite of ""casual"" - and required too much effort for majority of the players.
- There is NO way to perma-mute trolling or harassing players. I was lucky enough never to meet really stinky trolls in game, but once I was paired with ""widow only"" player 3 times in a row. This person admitted they are losing on purpose, so I reported/muted them - and I was still put into the same team 2 more times... Report system apparently don't work, and some players just insult everyone else, spoiling the mood a bit. They are never banned. As a result, there are trolls in every second game.
- There are too few maps, and map design is mediocre at best. 2 of the maps have the sole entrance in the beginning, which is easily blocked - that makes both defense and offense quite boring and repetitive quite often. Number of game modes isn't great either.
- Outside of the game, heroes are great - they have their own stories, agendas and characters. Ingame you do not feel of see ANY of that. Storywise, you don't understand why brutal killers from Talon are fighting on the same team, as their Overwatch adversaries, or why they are fighting at all.

- Astonishing graphics with minimum requirements from your hardware
- Unique character personalitiesIf I were to recommend this game at its launch date, I would honestly do it, but as it stands now I would not recommend this game to my worst enemy and I will explain below why with pros and cons:

Pros:

- If you wanted to play TF2 in the modern era, this game would be its successor.
- Astonishing graphics with minimum requirements from your hardware
- Unique character personalities that we can all identify with
- Music and sound effects are top notch
- Different ways to play the game, at least that's what they want us to believe

Cons:

-Balance is really out of control and it gets worse from patch to patch. Blizzard is unable to find a middle ground between overnerfing or overbuffing a hero, thus creating frustrations for months to come.
- Lack of transparency between Blizzard and its community. No patch notes for most of their updates.
They act like they care, but instead they do the opposite of what the community wants.

Example : D.va had gone through so many changes, back and forth, that her role isn't even clear at this point.

- Releases are really really rare. So far it's like 3 heroes per year, which compared to other games is not something to brag about. Events are not that often, you can count them with just one hand.

- Balance changes and bug fixes take forever to happen.
Example 1: Torbjorn's hammer was bugged, thus making him build and repairing turrets 25% slower, making him a pain to have on your team. Blizzard was aware of the bug, yet they fixed it after 3 months, 3 months in which Torbjorn was unplayable.

Example 2: Widowmaker had been nerfed since launch for her quick scope and easy kills. It took Blizzard more than a year to even start repairing her issues.

- Unless you have a group, it's extremely frustrating to play this game alone. The game focuses on 2 game modes:

1. Quickplay is oriented towards the casual scene where people can train and get the hang of new heroes. Problem is nobody is playing this mode as a team. Everyone chooses whatever they want to play with no regard to what the rest of the team needs to even have a chance of winning the game. Team cooperation is close to impossible, unless you've got a group which can easily cause you to regret playing the game. The matches are utterly either a stomp fest on you where the opposite team doesn't even let you touch the objective, or you're stomping the enemy team, thus making it unchallenging and boring for you. I've yet to see Quickplay matches actually fought on equal terms, it's always one team is superior to the other in most cases. It's the mostly the game's MMR that does a bad job at matching equally skilled players, whereas favoring how much a game is found for you, rather than the quality of it.

2. Competitive is meant to entertain the hardcore crowd, so you'd expect cooperation to be better than Quickplay. Well, yes and no. Most people do want to cooperate to win, but they literally force you to play whatever they want to make sure of it. Popular opinion is extremely influenced by the meta. If you're playing something out of the meta, they start being toxic towards you, before even getting a chance to show what you can do. This is literally the most toxic game that I've ever seen.

- Game is getting more and more casual with each patch. Player skill is starting to count less and less, while the accessibility of easy kills with hero abilities is rising with each patch.

Conclusion:

As it stands right now, do not buy this game.… Expand"

It has relatively solid game pla with a variety of heroes with different skill sets. This allows you to easily find one you prefer with the bonus of all of them being unlocked from the start. Another great thing about Overwatch is that micro transactions are only for cosmetics and so don’t give players an unfair advantage. The game also requires little time commitment however can be played for hours at a time without getting boring. Overwatch has a distinct art style which is consistent throughout its many maps. But this quickly gets boring with the lack of maps for each game mode. One of the best things are the events such as the 'summer games' which add a new game mode available for a short amount of time. These are good for when you get burnt-out. The voice acting is very good with multiple different voice lines for each character.

However, there are multiple flaws with the game such as the small amount of game modes. These are assault, escort, hybrid and control. However, this is increasing as recently as death match mode has been added. Another flaw is that it can be frustrating as a solo player when you are matched with pre-made teams. Another bad thing about this game is the fact that is doesn't have a single player/co-op campaign which is a disappointing due to the amount of lore behind each of its characters. The closest thing to a campaign ever added was a singular story mission which came with the games 'uprising' event which only lasted 3 weeks and then it was gone. This shows that blizzard has the tools to create a story mode but for some reason haven't. The worst thing is the community which insults and belittles you every time you do something which isn't to their liking. This is mainly in competitive however but can also occur in quick play occasionally.

It is better value for money now due to the fact more maps and heroes have been added since launch however can still get boring as some maps seem to appear more often than others.

2) Presence of some kind of lore and lore-connected content  (Overwatch doesn't have  real complete lore, plot or story it just has few articles on each hero's bio and some comics and shorts; even DOTA2 technically has better story implementation, although it doesn't have official short movies)

Cons:
1) Overwatch team prioritise money over content making. Instead of adding new heroes more often than once in 3-4 months  and new DIFFERENT (not ""slightly different maps with other textures"") maps, new mechanics and rules they just create completely useless, boring and repetitive ""events"" which usually introduce one casual gamemode and pile of dreadful cosmetic items (most of them have really bad quality) to make kids more excited and sexually aroused than normally.
2) Overwatch team completely  ignores game bugs and balance issues. For the AAA game overwatch has too many issues with that, which are not fixed or fixed partially after a huge period of time.
3) Overwatch team totally ignores feedback from competitive players. Moreover, blizzard community office  tries to pretend to be responsive by making dev's diaries and organising drama on their forums.
4) Overwatch is just boring to watch and play. Blizzard just did a really  bad job trying to develop Team Fortress's genre by adding heroes. Every game is the same, teamfights are won by those who charged their ults first and in the remaining time teams are just standing near objectives behind shields or cover (of they're flanking) and charging their ults again. That's it. I don't see any reason why i should explain why watching cybersport matches is dreadful (same picks, same spicks, same strategies).
5) Competitive gamemode and low skill cap. Even thought this game costs about 40$, the game is filled with inadequate whiners, leavers, complete noobs. I dare say that i enjoyed playing competitive dota, cs:go, RTS's and so on much more than competitive overwatch.

I could go on and review each specific issue with this game and each of blizzard's failures, but generally i said what i wanted to say. This game has no future in pro scene, unless blizzard will change their course and start to actually work on their game. This game just deserves online of 100k people on each platform, not more. Just don't buy it and wait until they'll make this game cost 20$ or free and add other microtransactions (apart from lootboxes).… Expand"

97,Telembrium,"Oct  1, 2017",2,"Overwatch is a game which has a good concept but a bad implementation. Poor map and mechanics design, poor graphics, a serious lack of writing talent, a featureless matchmaking system, and the microtransactions added on top are all factors which have contributed to Overwatch's failure to provide a fun experience.

With a single sentence, the closest one can get to describing the massiveOverwatch is a game which has a good concept but a bad implementation. Poor map and mechanics design, poor graphics, a serious lack of writing talent, a featureless matchmaking system, and the microtransactions added on top are all factors which have contributed to Overwatch's failure to provide a fun experience.

With a single sentence, the closest one can get to describing the massive amount of illogical, arbitrary, inconsistent, and counter-intuitive design that Overwatch is rife with using an example from the game is, ""Bear traps prevent time travel."" The base design of the game is both unique and functional, but where the developers go wrong is in the specifics. There's the apex of stupidity that is the mentioned example, but the game suffers no lack of design that exists within the same philosophy. I could prattle off countless instances: contact-detonated explosives being reflected with contact, electromagnetic pulses preventing running and yet not affecting rolls or jetpacks, flash bangs which immobilise players and violate the law of conservation of energy by nullifying all momentum while not affecting vision whatsoever—the list goes on. This design causes immense frustration for those learning the game and continues to be an annoyance long into a player's career.

The game's graphics are a mixed bag. Textures are blurry and many models could benefit from an increased polycount. Still, the cartoonish art style manages to keep the game looking passable and at times even pretty. Animations are basic, often lacking enough frames to look smooth. There is absolutely no lip-sync and only minor modelling of facial expressions, so characters will not open their mouths when speaking, and those on the brink of death simply look bored or slightly irritated. Granted, this level of graphical fidelity does allow for higher framerates, but crisp textures and higher polycount models should be available for those who have the systems to handle them.

Map design in Overwatch is shockingly poor. The majority of the maps use one of two game modes: Attack/Defence and KoTH. Both of these game modes are inherently flawed, as the game balance is wildly skewed without a mobile point of battle. Most A/D and KoTH matches devolve into spawn camping or repeatedly walking into a kill box. Additionally, the developers have added countless bottomless pits to the maps in places that make no sense for the sake of having them for certain character's abilities. The remaining maps utilise a payload game mode, which plays well but is still plagued by random pits.

The game's writing is awful. Characters can have their entire backstory described with a single sentence: Mercy is a Swiss doctor that abhors violence, Zarya is a strong, Russian woman, DoomFist is a black man that steals things, and McCree is a cowboy. These sensational designs are among the many ""heroes"" that Blizzard uses as one of the game's selling points. Like the character designs, the story is near nonexistent. The best that can be ascertained is that there was an international policing organisation which was disbanded after failing at their job, and now the ex-members are teaming up with known criminals to fight clones of themselves.

By far, the largest issue that besets Overwatch is the lack of a sophisticated matchmaking system. The current system could tentatively be called functional, but even that is a stretch. It lacks basic features such as map and ping filtering, and the matches it creates are frequently unbalanced. It will reconnect players to matches that they have manually disconnected from, making it impossible to escape trolls and cheaters without waiting several minutes for the slots to be refilled. You'll also be punished for leaving matches through the application of a reduced XP penalty. This is mostly irrelevant, but it leaves the player feeling scorned when the reason they're disconnecting is the game's fault.

If all the previous failings weren't bad enough, get ready to be milked for every cent you're worth with microtransactions. Loot boxes and loot are constantly advertised. Labels proclaiming 'New!' are everywhere, and even the in-game menu offers you the ability to disconnect from the match (with punishment) to buy or open loot boxes. The items these loot boxes hold are thankfully cosmetic but don't fail to break the artstyle. People running around in gaudy outfits and Halloween costumes and yells of ""Would you like the sponge or the spray?"" are no stranger to the combat of Overwatch. Many items are memes and/or break the fourth wall.

In short, Overwatch is a good game concept with bad game design. Arbitrary mechanic design, poor map design, poor writing, well-performing yet poor quality graphics, a barely functional matchmaking system that punishes the player for its failures, and microtransactions as a rotten cherry on top of an ant-ridden ice cream sundae make it clear to label this game with the bottom line of: Avoid.… Expand"
