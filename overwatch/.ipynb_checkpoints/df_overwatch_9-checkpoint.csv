Anyways, I played the beta and it was a blast. The 21 heroes are all unique and varied, they all have great abilities, and the lack of equippable weapons will make the game feel fair and balanced through the years.
Some of them feel a bit OP, but I'm sure Blizz will balance the characters so everyone's on a level playing field.
There are currently 4 gamemodes, control points, payload, hybrid, and king of the hill. They're all fun and getting objectives done with teammates is fun.
The overall game design is also fantastic, the visuals are sort of cartoonish, but with a bit of realism mixed in, and it looks very good. The game is also well optimized on PC, which is honestly the best platform to play on, as I feel reaction time and being quick to counter an enemy is best done with a mouse and a controller joystick is rather clunky and less accurate for a shooter like this,.
The customizability options are really good, too, many sprays(not stickers), skins, voice clips, emotes, and victory poses are incredible.
However, the game is not perfect, and I have a couple complaints.
The PotG is not good at all, and focuses mostly on killstreaks, and forgoes plays by, for example, support pushing a team and overall being very helpful. They're there, but few and far between.
Also, the loot boxes are poorly done I find, Blizz is notorious for putting terrible RNG in their games, which is a total minus for me, loot is random, poorly, I might add. You'd be hard pressed to get little more than a boring spray most of the time. At least the loot boxes are only for customizability, and not for game changing additions like more powerful weapons or something. I just wish the customizability wasn't so hard to come by.
those nitpicks only knock the score to a 9/10, but this is still a great game, well worth the $40.
Also, I've seen some very poorly made reviews here. You don't give the game a 0 or 1 because you expected a single player when the game was MARKETED as a Multiplayer only shooter, not to mention most of Blizzard's games are online-only. Also, complaining about the game being only f2p, are you freaking nuts? Competitive is coming next month and Blizzard wanted it to be good enough for the players, and didn't want to delay the game, also more content will no doubt be added later on, so suck it up and stop complaining, your opinion deserves to be called out if it's made questionably. Also, I understand not liking the game, but giving the game 0s and 1s? Give me a break. Then again, Metacritic is full of people who don't have any idea what they're talking about and shouldn't make reviews at all, so yeah.… Expand"
1,Hellion,"May 27, 2016",4,Pass on this. Nothing new except maybe the art style of the game is pretty good. Should have been a free to play game with the option to pay for the skins. Needed a single player mini campaign or something to add some story for each character. Multiplayer matches are quick and for the most part fun but it's get pretty boring quickly.
2,nothingnew,"May 27, 2016",10,"it is a beautiful game with very interesting characters that have unique ways that you could play them there will be a ""hero"" for your play-style i found this game very enjoyable and i see overwatch lasting a while before people stop playing it"
3,GraffPirate,"May 27, 2016",8,"an extremely polished game. my only issue is the map sizes and design. too many bottle necks and small spaces for such a frenetic combat driven game. class systems seem bound to map layouts. Im having a lot of fun playing it we shall see how the meta game evolves. Also there is no taunting, Im sad about this."
4,VoidSoldier,"May 27, 2016",8,"Overwatch is the most fun I've had with a game in quite some time. That's a feat, because I have not had much fun with FPS games since the likes of Halo Reach and old TF2. It has it's cons but the pros outweigh them no question, as I will list now.

Pros:
- 21 heroes all with massively different play-styles, designs and personalities. More heroes are to be added.
-Fair amount of maps,Overwatch is the most fun I've had with a game in quite some time. That's a feat, because I have not had much fun with FPS games since the likes of Halo Reach and old TF2. It has it's cons but the pros outweigh them no question, as I will list now.

Pros:
- 21 heroes all with massively different play-styles, designs and personalities. More heroes are to be added.
-Fair amount of maps, all based on areas of the world in the future like London, Egypt, Siberian Russia, and Japan
-Maps are tailored to the game type making play fluid and coherent
-Payload, Capture the point and defend the point are all fun, some have both mixed in, like Numbani
-Metagame is ever evolving, making ""mastering"" the game an addictive and changing task
-Progression is addicting, no level cap, loot boxes unlocked each level, and several achievements to unlock keeps the game very re-playable and hard to stop when on a good run
-Skill ceiling is potentially quite high but also fun and intuitive for casuals
-Weekly brawl keeps you coming back for more. Can be absurdly fun.
-Objective based game-play means you can really feel like you are impacting on your teams success, and stops the game becoming an incoherent deathmatch.

There are some cons, however:

-So far only two game types- Payload and Capture point/ Defend and attack point, may limit the games long-term re-playability
-No single player campaign. This is not necessarily a bad thing but it is a bit disappointing considering the seemingly interesting lore to the game, and the vibrant characters. The animated shirts on YouTube are really amazing, however.
-High price for an online only shooter, but future heroes and maps will all be free, and the game is very polished. Cosmetics can be unlocked through earned loot boxes and currency, but also bough with real money.
-Lack of team communication can be frustrating, so a ready made team of friends will usually destroy a team of randomers
-Custom games can not be put into matchmaking. When joining a quickplay match, you have no choice over game type or map.

Also, when opening loot boxes, opening many that you have can be very fun and exiting, but if you open them one by one, the contents of the box can be disappointing. Skins, victory poses and highlight intros are blatantly more satisfying than sprays and emotes. But when you do get them it's even better. Each time you level up you get a loot box but leveling up gets much slower as you go, so the amount of loot boxes you will be earning will go down. Items in the store like skins and emotes are usually 75 credits, which is very little in this game, I assure you. Some cost more at 200, for epic items. Legendary items cost 1000 and I like this, because I don't want everybody to have every legendary skin, it takes the reward out of it.

So to sum up, this is a fun and flashy shooter that is fun and addictive in the short term, hard to stop playing in a night. Ranked is not in the game as of now but will be added. The metagame is always changing and mastering heroes is fun. Hero switching means countering heroes gives an element of strategy to the game. The game feels a bit empty right now but I'm in no doubt more maps and gamemodes will be added soon- and new heroes are going to shake up the metagame. A lack of campaign is sad since the lore is very interesting but I have no doubt many shorts and comics will be released- perhaps a movie! Blizzard did it with Warcraft so why not?

I recommend for players who like games like TF2, or even other FPS games like CS:GO. Even if you don't like FPS games this is fun enough that you may just enjoy it. Don't be seduced by the adverts, however, they completely mis-advertise the game, know that this is purely an online shooter. The game is also superior on the PC due to the fast nature of the game.

Final score of 8. Very fun and flashy, but may not be long lasting if many more maps and modes are added, and I hope it doesn't share the fate of games like Titanfall, but Blizzards loyal fanbase should prevent that happening, especially on PC.… Expand"

Having an average of 92 on metacritic makes no sense at all and one can not help but suspect that blizzard is bribing these ''professional critics'', even destructoid one of my most respected gaming sites gave it a perfect 100%...they can't be serious. I mean even for the casual gamer who only plays mobas, counter strike, or some free p2w mmo giving it a 10 is just too much.

Don't get me wrong. Overwatch is not a bad game. On the contrary, it can be quite enjoyable at first with its colorful graphics, tight gameplay and limited but quite balanced character rooster. Even more so if you play it with a couple of friends. But there are only so many things one can do in an online only (60$ no singleplayer...wtf?) game with very few stages and extremely limited game modes. I do believe that eventually you will get tired of the game's repetition but then again I might be underestimating the casual gamer. And what's up with those disgusting rng boxes? Ok so they might not be mandatory because they will only give you cosmetic upgrades but it's still like blizzard is begging for more of your money. First it was day one dlcs and microtransactions then season passes and now we get multiplayer only games like Battlefront, The Division (don't tell me about its singleplayer missions) and now Overwatch. I wouldn't even mind about all that but see, people are buying these games giving the greedy developers motivation to make more of the same since these are the games that sell the most.

It's all very sad. Not because these repetitive multiplayer games are overshadowing other worthwhile or even great singleplayer games that have been crafted with much care and love by their developers. Not even because these despicable exercises of greed are becoming a trend in α declining gaming industry. What saddens me the most is that most of these casual gamers will probably never bother giving a chance to all those wonderful games that already exist and will instead keep on with their lives as they have. But then again it might just be me that doesn't  get the point of multiplayer games like overwatch. There is one thing however that I think we call all agree upon. In a full priced game wouldn't it be nice to have the best of both worlds, both multiplayer and singleplayer, so that everyone can be happy? I say yes.… Expand"

I have only ran into minimal bugs since playing and no of which was when playing. The heros are done well and I'm always swapping between them.

I can't imagine that the map count would be any different especially since that seems to be the way map content in games is shifting.

1. the mechanics/movement/ are superb in my opinion. all the characters play/feel different since they are all different sizes and have different abilities so there is a character for everyone, which brings me to my second point.
2. Diversity. the fact that i can choose from 21 completely different characters that have different looks, feels, abilities, play styles is probably one of the best features about this game. your not just a generic soldier amongst other generic soldiers, each character was well thought out by blizzard.
3. art style: the art style and animations of each character truly bring them to life and make for very interesting personalities.
4. gameplay: the gameplay in my opinion is really really fun because you can play however you want. I'm not the type to go all out and be in the front lines so a support character like Mercy is the one for me. I can do my part by standing in the sidelines and provide support for those who need it. The good thing is since there are offense/defence/tank/support everyone will be able to find a play style that suits them.
5. one price: so far blizzard has said that for the $60, all the dlc and heroes will be includes which is refreshing to hear since companies want to charge up to $50 for new maps/features which is ridiculous (looking at you cod). overall i do think this game should be played with people you know because you have to have a well balanced team with different abilities. can't wait for Monday :) let the watch begin!… Expand"

Some people have problems with the tick rate (20)  some have problems with blizzards ""favor the shooter"" mechanics, some have problems with ultimate abilities and the new cosmetic crates that blizzard wants you to pay for (although you get them passively through just playing the game and each crate costs under a dollar if you're impatient) but nobody can deny that the game is fun without sounding a little spiteful

I'm here to tell you like it is, and this comes from a TF2 player with roughly 2000 hours of TF2 played, from the beginning (0 itemization on TF2 characters, no hats, no metal, no keys, no crates, etc.) to roughly 2 years ago, when the game became a drag for me.

When I look at Overwatch I see a lot of characters that are deeply rooted in TF2 characters simply because of how the character works and what role they play. However, these characters are generally acceptable because they have abilities that distance themselves from other playable classes in other games. I will not be drawing direct comparisons because if you look at the characters you can draw these lines for yourself. What I am willing to say is that imitation is the best form of flattery.

What I will also say is that what happened at Blizzards round table is obvious. Blizzard took a look at old games, took what they enjoyed best and what worked best to them, and decided to implement those things in their WIP; and there's nothing wrong with that. What you will mainly see in these reviews are people that are mad about characters that are obviously easier to play for new players (bastion, reinhardt etc.) and call out the nerf hammer or just say ""it's a rip off and it costs money oh and I'm bored already"" and just dismiss the game, which 350 have done, and they have every right to, but in my eyes it is a great injustice.

The first time I played Overwatch, which was in the free beta not too long ago, I played solo most of the time, as i still do. I swapped my characters when I felt I should based on the enemy team and found who I was proficient at and who I wasn't, which I feel should be every new players intention. I did draw conclusions as to who acted similarly to TF2 characters and was amazed at the new abilities and new ideas that blizzard brought to the table. Yes, you have Roadhogs hook which is like Pudge from Dota, or Blitzcrank from league, but this is new ground in an arena shooter, and it is equally as satisfying. What I didn't do was become bummed out at similarities that I found; I actually enjoyed these similarities because that's what I enjoyed from previous titles as well, even if they were from different devs.

What I noticed next was the fluid motion of characters and how smooth everything played out. Yes, I was flash banged by a Mccree many times, which causes a break in the action, and Mei did freeze me quite a few times, but it didn't make me rage, it made me want to think. Instead of figuring out which hat i was going to wear in TF2 I was actually thinking about how i can get around certain characters and what character I should play in order to beat the opposition and win. NOT get the most kills.

One of the last things I noticed was the play of the game (POTG) which, sometimes, I admit can be a let down, but ultimate abilities are very satisfying to successfully use. You will find many players getting upset at ""broken"" ultimates but as time passes players adapt, this is also where individual player skill comes in, yes, even with Soldier76's aimbot. In short, even the most seemingly broken ultimate requires timing and a bit of finesse in order to catch more seasoned players out.

All in all I'm having fun with Overwatch and will continue to do so in the foreseeable future. I endorse both solo play and playing with friends. I enjoy the graphics and the mechanics. I enjoy the learning curve and most if not all of the maps currently available. Blizzard may not have made the most original arena shooter ever but it doesn't deserve the rap it gets from the peanut gallery.

TL;DR, don't listen to the angry TF2 fanboys, trolls, and naysayers who caused this game such grief simply because they outright dismiss the game for having a few issues, and certainly don't let it put you off of getting the game. This game holds its own. In reality this game is a 9.2 in my book, but i'm giving it a 10 to counteract some of these unbelievable reviews and dismissals. Ridiculous.… Expand"

1. Blizzard never marketed this game to have a campaign. If you saw any article pre-release, which was pretty hard to avoid, as advertisements were (and are) everywhere, you'd know that Overwatch is a multiplayer-only game. No one EVER said that this game was going to have a single player campaign.

2. People are complaining about the game having no competitive mode at launch. This is a valid point, although the strategy Blizzard went with isn't horrible. Many people gave feedback during the beta about how to improve the ranked and spectator systems, and Blizzard are still working on it. As a personal opinion, I don't mind that they launched the game without competitive ONLY because it is launching so soon after release; competitive's release is slated for the end of June. I've been having fun in quick play learning how the game works and how the characters play. Even if Overwatch did come with ranked at launch, I wouldn't have jumped into it without being adept at the game anyway.

3.  People are saying that the game should be F2P (free to play) but they must not know what that actually entails. F2P games give you a few free characters, with other characters on a rotation that shifts every so often, and the rest (often the best ones) are locked behind a paywall. Also behind this paywall are downloadable content and everything else. Blizzard has promised all upcoming DLC (characters, maps, etc) will be free. In the end, a one-time payment with all content included in the purchase is better than a F2P model.

4. I've read several reviews about the game being aimed at casual players and/or lacking content. These arguments are misguided. First off, this game has a lot of depth and a high skill ceiling. In the coming months, people are going to start finding new tech and new ways to use characters that will only push the ceiling higher. Like Rocket League or Super Smash Bros Melee, Overwatch can be a sort of party game that low-level players can enjoy, but also a game with huge esports potential. If Blizzard can listen to the community and get the ranked/spectator systems right, Overwatch could gain a large esports following. Second, the game has one unranked mode, training, custom games, and an ""arcade"" mode, which some suggest constitutes a lack of content. I agree that the game is lacking content, but what people fail to understand is that a ton of content =/= a ton of replayability. The core game mechanics of this game make every match feel fresh. The objectives are the same, but the way I've been approaching them is different every time. There are so many different viable team compositions and ways to play that Overwatch's replayability is massive. I'll use Rocket League again as an example, and this counts for all sports games as well: The maps are the same, the objectives are the same, but every match feels different because the games' mechanics allow the player to be creative in how they approach them, and it's past-paced and just plain fun.

This is my unbiased opinion (I've never played a Blizzard game before and therefore have no company loyalty) and I hope this helps people to understand why this game is so good.… Expand"

2. Gameplay was very repetitive for me. So I couldn't take more than an hour a day of this ... shooter. I was trying like 5 heroes a day but in the end you will have to choose the hero that your team need to win. So I always must play heroes with extremly boring gameplay for me in order to get a win.
4. It was also surprising for me that a game with small maps and little players number has such system requirements. I can only hope this was and intended feature of the game's engine so that it will develop more efficient or smth like that.
3. They were making a free to play game, but when the main development was over they made a f2p game cost 40$! So basically it is a worse quality game because it was meant to be free, but they unlocked donation content so you have to pay for it a lot.
After all, I can say that this game wasn't innovative or addictively fun to play. I gave a 6 to this game, cause it also has quite intresting story for each character, but it is completely ignored in the game, when everybody is killing each other with no lore reason and there can be 2 and more same heroes at the same time on the batlleground, so it was the same mistake like in heroes of the storm. I wonder how the game could've be if there were 2 opposite alliances of heroes like in wow, and the battlegrounds were actually some sort of scenarios and had at least some kind of intro for them on the loading screens.

-20 tick rate servers (20 refreshes per second). Modern FPS games used 60 tick or higher. This means that Blizzard cheaped out and is using a netcode model that was popular back when dial-up was still a thing. It also leads to a lot of unnecessary and frustrating deaths as the low update rate and their server prediction algorithms kill you because your own reactions to situations fail to register in time. Considering the fast-paced nature of the game, this money-grubbing decision by Blizzard makes the game frustrating for anyone with any kind of FPS experience and skill. It is currently one of the most hotly debated topics on their message boards, which they are ignoring. This issue, if not addressed makes the idea of Overwatch becoming an e-sport a complete joke.

-Poor matchmaking (hopefully this sorts itself out as people supposedly have ratings that help them adjust their matchmaking accordingly) and accusations that they are using the same kind of matchmaking as Heroes of the Storm which forces people into games where they get stomped repeatedly if they win rate goes too high over 50%.

-RNG crackboxes for cosmetics. This is a pretty blatant cash grab and preys on the psychology behind gambling addition, which some people are susceptible to. They should have kept random loot boxes for leveling but allowed you to buy whatever skins/emotes/sprays you want like they do in Heroes of the Storm and World of Warcraft. This decision was probably forced upon them by Activision who aren't afraid to do anything to maximize profits.

-Hero stacking and poor hero balance. Some heroes are quite powerful while others are just meh. ""Pro"" teams stack the powerful ones. Some heroes are extremely cheesy when stacked, like Bastion and Torbjorn, to name two. There is currently no limit on how many of one specific hero can be used.

-Missing features at launch e.g. no Competitive Mode. Yet the cash shop works perfectly.

-Two-faced policy when it comes to banning cheaters. 2 ""pro"" players were busted for using aimbots in Overwatch competitive play. They were not banned and are still making streams, playing competitively and making bank from the game. Yet Blizzard states a zero-tolerance policy for cheating and claims to have banned people caught. So it seems like if you're a ""pro"" player and bring visibility to the game from an e-sports perspective and help Blizzard make more inroads into the e-sports scene, you are treated differently from everyone else.

The graphics, animations and sound are all excellent. The game looks good and runs well. If they can address the gameplay issues outlined above, the game is definitely one of the best shooters on the market but if they don't, it's going to sour the community fast.… Expand"

As far as reasonable expectations go, Overwatch is a damn fine steak, though.

The hero roster is great, the maps are well designed, the gameplay is very fluid and satisfying. Although there could be more game modes or some extra dynamic events on the maps, the package is quite solid as it is.

66,ExpositionFairy,"May 26, 2016",8,"A surprisingly great take on FPS by Blizzard which, in my opinion, lives up to the hype. Here's why:

Pros:

Pros:
- The game is easy to get into, yet hard to master. There are characters suited to all kinds and levels of playstyles - which I think is great! Each character feels unique to play, offering a diversity of experiences.
- To win in Overwatch, you need to have a good understanding of how characters work together or against each other tactically, and how team comps compare to each other, as well as how you can strategically use the map to your advantage. However, your reflexes also make a contribution - for example, if you're good at aiming AND strategy, you can really shine with a hero like Tracer. Overwatch has just the right balance between these two contributing factors - it's not like a MOBA where almost everything is decided by tactics; and it's not CS:GO where aim is the largest influence.
- Because games are quite short, losses generally don't feel punishing, yet winning can be very exciting.
- When compared to a MOBA or a game like CS:GO, where your previous success has an influence on your future success (e.g. whether you have enough money to buy the items you need), in Overwatch this factor is eliminated completely, making last-minute comebacks possible and extremely satisfying.
- Overwatch's pay-to-play model guarantees that there will be no game-breaking factors in the future, as well as free content updates in the future as stated by the developers. It also ensures that people will be less prone to purchase new accounts in the future and break the game for newcomers. Finally, the P2P model holds a promise of a better community.

Cons:
- Netcode. In my opinion, this is the game's biggest issue at the moment. Currently, issues where you receive damage after you are already in cover or have used an escape ability are quite frequent. Blizzard will certainly have to do something about this when it comes to ranked play.
- Ranked play. It has not been released as of yet, so it is not fair to judge on this yet; however, if ranked is anything like the closed beta was, it will certainly need revisions if Overwatch wants to see a future in e-sports.

Neutral:
- The game is very fast-paced, which to some will feel very fun, yet to others may feel overwhelming.… Expand"

2) Blizzard has a fantastic marketing team. I think the shorts are better than the actual game. They've really created a world that is exciting and interesting.
3) Blizzard has some pretty devoted fanboys/girls. Many companies have blindly devoted and un-objective fans, and Blizzard is no different. It helps that this is their first new IP in ages, as well as Blizzard's first foray into the FPS market.

The actual gameplay? It's alright. I was never a fan of asymmetric competitive shooters, so that doesn't help. In general I find the game to be just... decent. Not bad at all, but not great either. I played every character in the beta for a few hours, and I can tell this will be another game that I play for a few weeks and then slowly stop once the buzz wears off.

Overwatch is an Arena Team Based Shooter with MOBA skills into it, so making comparisons with Battleborn makes no sense. That being said, the game is solid. Graphics are cartoonish and stylish, especially noticeable is that you will always understand what is going on on your screen and that's really important in a game like this. Content-wise there is not so much right now but I do think that is not a real problem, first because Blizzard is always updating their games, second because what is important is the gameplay.
Gameplay-wise is where Overwatch shines the most. Fast-paced, skill-based and team compositions are fundamental aspects of the game, so it is highly recommended to play with friends. Each character feels unique and needs a different degree of training to be properly used, also the idea that you can swap characters during the match makes counter attacks much easier and avoids unnecessary boredom from people who cannot use that specific hero, if you are not good, you just change to someone more suited and go right back into the action. Apart from balanced issues (get ready to be headshoted everywhere by Hanzos in a few weeks) one problem is the absence of the sprint button for all heroes (apart Soldier 76), this leads to long walking times, but at the same time, it allows to be careful to engage because you cannot run so quickly off the action. Maps are pretty easy to memorize but have some nice ""twists"", like certain areas can be access quicker only by some heroes, increasingly the importance of a balance team.
I still have to understand how Blizzard was able to develop a game that feels ""easy"" in both the mechanics and the settings while still having a lot of depth, the game designers are pretty good at their jobs I would say,
Overall, Overwatch feels like a really polished game. Matchmaking is fast (only one time had connections problem and always zero lag at day one). Grab a couple of friends and jump in, this game will stay on the market for a long time so no worries about new content.

There is also a strange leavers penalty system that I don't feel belongs in the quick play section of this game as it feels very drop in, drop out, I can understand why it would be there in competitive mode but not in the casual ones.

Pros:-
◾-Beautiful aesthetic, impressive sound design and animations as well as amazing character and level designs.
◾-Very unique playstyle for each character out of the 21 available now, there are classes (tank, support, offense, defense) like in all team-based arena shooters but even within each class every character feels like a whole different beast to learn and master.
◾-Impressive assortment of cosmetics, character skins, player icons, sprays (you can put them on walls in-game), character intros, emotes and victory poses for every character.
◾-Blizzard seal of quality, game is super polished, had a very smooth launch and plays like magic with zero glitches or problems (there were few glitches in open Beta but they are gone now), expect long years of support and free content as well, after all Blizzard still release patches for their decade old games like Diablo 2 and Starcraft: Broodwar.

Cons:-
◾-Few gameplay modes, sure you can play custom and Brawl where the rules can be dramatically changed but still in Quick Play (the main gameplay mode) there are only three gameplay modes (Point Capture, Payload and Assault) and one Hybrid, it would have been great if the game released with more modes but they surely will add more in the coming updates.
◾-Some game systems could use a bit of tweaking like Play of the Game (a cool feature that saves and replays the best moment in the game for everyone to watch), a lot of times it's something awesome and exciting, other times it's mundane and even nonsensical and comical (like showing the Engineer Torbjörn dead on the floor while his turret is doing all the kills), a few tweaks to the algorithms of how PotG is selected would prevent such silly things from happening.

Two last things regarding the idiots panning the for the most stupid and retarded reasons, all of the cosmetic stuff in the game you can earn by just playing and leveling up, if you are impatient you can buy extra loot chests to get stuff faster, but nothing obliges you to do so, basically don't listen to the idiots who are whining about loot boxes shop, it's 100% optional and the game offers loot boxes at a steady rate every level up (there is no level cap, level exp requirements flatline at lv.22 and reset every 100 levels), Mass Effect 3 Multiplayer used the same exact system and it worked great, that money will help keep the game alive for years and support all the costs of adding new free heroes, new maps, play modes and features  (and pay server maintenance costs), i don't see any reason whatsoever to complain about the loot boxes shop, unless you just want to troll.

2nd, i can't believe this site still allows zero score reviews, it is beyond ridiculous how some people acting like 5 years old bullies who might not have even bought or played the game can just write a pile of hateful crap and it somehow that **** counts as a review, the one affected most negatively by this utter lack of criteria for reviews is actually the site itself.

This game has the perfect amount of content right now.  21 diverse heroes all with immense strategic depth.  There are 12 maps, and I haven't played any of them thinking ""this map is meh, I don't like it when it comes up.""  They are all amazing.  Each part of a map is a strategic opportunity for a hero.  There are 3 game modes.  This is an excellent recipe for a COMPETITIVE game---which is exactly what Overwatch is.  In a competitive game, you don't want 10 different game modes and 30 different maps.  With that much content, it is hard to learn map layouts and game modes and their respective strategies.  And by learn, I'm not talking casual learning where you feel like you know the game pretty well after several hours of play.  I'm talking about hundreds of hours of play on each map and each game mode and with each hero.  This is how you are supposed to approach competitive games.  You need to embrace the ""lack of variety"" (although Overwatch is the polar opposite of lack of variety) and instead focus on being better than everyone else at maps, modes, heroes, and other elements of the game.  A good reference for this concept is League of Legends.  That game has been out since 2009 and for mainstream competitive play (so not counting Twisted Treeline) there is only one map and one game mode---and that is a large part of LoL's competitive success.

People also complain that this game has no single player element.  Well it actually does.  The Practice Range.  It's a great place to study a hero's mechanics.  This is a must for a competitive game.  What this game doesn't have is a single player campaign.  It doesn't need one in my opinion, however if Blizzard added one in the future I wouldn't complain.  I know it'd be pretty dope.
Now for the review of the game itself.  Not going to spend much time here.  It's extremely fun.  The replay value is insanely high (per the first paragraph).  Each hero is very unique and plays in their own way.  You can dump hundreds of hours into a hero and will still need to work on other heroes, since the game is designed to encourage switching heroes mid-game depending on the situation at hand.  Even if that's not the case, you will want to benefit from a diverse team so only sticking with one or two heroes will still stifle your playing potential.  The gameplay is very fun and diverse as well.  No two matches feel alike.

I have found nothing wrong with this game.  Absolutely nothing.  I like and respect Blizzard but I'm not a fanboy by any stretch of the imagination.  Their only other games I've played are Diablo III, and was only into that for a couple months (really really fun game though), and Hearthstone.  As a competitive character based game, yes some of the heroes are annoying as heck to play against but this isn't something that's wrong with the game.  This is present is any game like this, League of Legends, Dota 2, Heroes of the Storm, Team Fortress 2, you name it.

So I'm just going to list all the generic good stuff about this game that you are probably here wondering:
- Graphics/Art Style (the art style and character design is what drew me to this game).
-Gameplay
-Music/Sound (really love the soundtrack, a lot.  I'm a sucker for game soundtracks)
-Replay value
-Honestly, any other game review parameter you can think of, this game meets it.

Overall this game definitely warrants all the hype.  If you're still on the fence then I guess this just aint a game for you OR you should just watch more gameplay videos.… Expand"
91,acronym123,"May 25, 2016",10,Cool game with a lot of interesting characters and technicalities. There is a wide variety of play styles that ensure that every game will be different. The best part of the game is that there are effective counters to every hero in the game which will prevent any one hero from becoming too overpowered. Can't wait to see what else Blizzard does with their newest IP.

I was unsure about this game until I played open beta - I even let my closed beta invite slip since I was preoccupied elsewhere. But after playing open beta - I couldn't wait for the game to be released. It's just a lot of fun.

Most of the heroes are very easy to play - although this is also complimented by the fact that how well you perform depends drastically on your skill. I think this works well for both casual players as well as more serious competitive players. I can't see how people are complaining about lack of content. It's a blizzard game - this is only just launch and it has shipped with a whole bunch of maps and heroes. With more coming in the future.

Some people were under the impression that the game would release with more content than in beta. Of course developers are not likely to be trying to push out new content than their BETA version of the game - being busy with bug fixing and extra polishing (after all that is the purpose of a beta).
Another negative point that really annoyed me was a whole bunch of people who gave it lower scores as it had no single player or campaign. I find this on par with someone complaining about TF2, CSGO, LOL etc. as having no single player campaign - it's just ridiciously. There are a ton of multiplayer games only - I could understand people complaining about this in the days of dial up; but otherwise all I can say is - if you're looking for a single player game then of course this game isn't for that.

A few reviews and people also are under the impression that all the heroes are OP and it only takes one ultimate etc. for automatic kills. To be honest, I felt the same way when I started. But eventually you hopefully realize that different heroes have different counters. And that avoiding certain ultimates is not that hard. I mean - this is just an example - if you ever felt that Pharah's ult is OP; then you should try play her. Her ult leaves you completely vulnerable and covering only moderate-small spaces.
That's not to say the game is perfectly balanced obviously.… Expand"

You play as Overwatch as the nerd you are pitting your favorite characters against eachother in a team deathmatch and thats it... Now when did that become a bad thing!? Batman on the same team as joker in Infinite Crisis = No problem, but here it's the reason for a 0score review?

Why you buy a multiplayer only game like R6Siege, CSGO or WoW and expect a offline singleplayer story mode? Let me guess, you didn't even buy the game and review it, you just wrote negative reviews that help nobody because we all know it's multiplayer only you don't need to tell anybody.

It's like this:
SHUTTER ISLAND MOVIE REVIEW: ""0/10 did not laugh, not a comedy, no fun!"" No **** sherlock?

I even saw reviews about how poor the Xbox version is... ON THE PC VERSIONS METACRITIC PAGE! Like come on guys, wtf!?

It's a game where you just put your favorite characters against your other favorite characters and like rocket league or triathalons: It does not have to make sence!

CHAPTER TWO:

There are also a lot of people complaining that it's not a p2w errhm...  i mean, f2p game. Now how would you like it if you got in a que with that dude who only had Bastion in a game where changing your hero is almost more important than aiming? Would you like beeing on the offence with one useless guy on the team? NO YOU WOULD NOT. Thats like asking for SC2 to be a F2P game where you must unlock units for your faction. IT IS THE STUPIDEST IDEA EVER! 40$ ain't even much when you get all future updates and heroes for free.

CHAPTER 3

""But it is micro transactions in the game!!!111!!1! derp derp""
Is it? I didn't even notice. It maybe because i don't give a rats arse about skins and voice-packs that you can unlock for free just playing the game.

The tight, fast paced gameplay, in combination with glittering game worlds and unique, interesting heroes to play with promises some good fun to be had. The key issue is- where is the rest of it?

21 heroes is plenty for release, and the interplay of direct counters (such as snipers hitting the large bodies of tanks with ease) make the strategic elements in the game great. However, you get 12 maps and only 3 game modes. THREE.

I played this game thoroughly throughout the beta, and I had a fantastic time testing out characters, understanding tactics for each objective and so on. The issue is, once you have got to grips with it all, what else is there? No ranking progression, no single player, and merely vague promises of additional maps and heroes coming.. as usual for blizzard ""Soon TM"".

If you are the kind of person who can play the same experience for hundreds of hours on end (which admittedly is likely a large portion of the FPS player base), then sink your money without care. Those of us who enjoy variety might want to steer clear until a more appropriate price point is settled or more content has been added.

I think the life span for the game is an issue, and it could go the way of most other AAA purely online shooters- barren within months… Expand"

Now, this isn't saying all that much, as I'm only 15 and I'm generally not a huge fan of FPS titles, but this is a really, really fun game. For those of you who just want my score and a quick summary, I won't make you scroll down to the bottom of the post, here you go:
9.5/10 Overwatch, is fun, frantic, and charming, with some of the best balancing I've ever seen in a shooter, and incredibly well crafted ""easy to learn, hard to master"" gameplay. There are a couple of characters that are no fun whatsoever to try and fight, and the game is slightly lacking in content at launch, but knowing how much effort Blizzard puts into the longevity of their games, I'm sure these issues will be resolved, and we'll be left with one of the best arena shooters ever made.
Presentation: This game looks fantastic. The graphics are great, the art style is unique and eye catching, and it's extremely well optimized, at least on PC. The thing that really stood out to me, however, is the level of detail put into the environments that bring them to life. There are semi-destructible vending machines and arcade cabinets, little references to other Blizzard titles, and even a few games of Hearthstone left running (I would assume at Rank 20, as everyone is still running silverback patriarch). Props to blizzard on some of the most amazing looking maps in a game to date.
Gameplay: Ah yes, the most important thing in any shooter, and I'm happy to say that this is perhaps Overwatch's strongest aspect. Everything is fast and fluid, the maps and team sizes are designed in such a way that you feel like you're having an impact but never that you lost because of one bad player, the level design is great and gives each hero unique ways of traversing the map, and I hardly ever feel as if I'm just running into a kill trap over and over without a way to do something about it. The only thing I would suggest in this category is that occasionally it feels as if one team has advantage over another simply based on level layout, usually with the payload matches.
Balancing: Overwatch is incredibly well balanced, which is impressive given that it just came out. Many heroes are direct counters to each other, so that one player can't dominate the match. It's extremely well thought out. Probably my only complaint in this area is Bastion, who needs a really big nerf very soon. His DPS is insane, and he can wipe out an entire team in about 6 seconds. But overall, the game feels very fair.
Content: My only real problem with the game, but even this I'm not that worried about. There are quite a few modes I'd like to see, as well as better friend options, and given how cool the game's lore looks, I'd love to see a singleplayer or co-op campaign introduced sometime down the road. But, knowing blizzard and how well the handle DLC and expansions, I'm confident we'll soon have more content than we know what to do with. Overall, Overwatch has a ridiculous amount of potential, and a developer who I know is willing to explore that potential. Buckle in, everybody. We're in for one hell of a ride.… Expand"
