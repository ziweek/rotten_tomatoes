Played in a party all night and had a blast. The most fun I have had in a game... since I can remember. Best purchase of 2016 so far. Don't miss out on this game."

Overwatch is so much fun, and the reason behind that is all the variety and ways to perform in combat. It looks great too. Battleborn is the ugly rip off of Overwatch and is about as fun as Star Fox Wii."

One of the issues I have with the game is that shift is an ability and not sprint (unless your Solider 76). I am getting use to it but I've been programmed to hit shift for running.

The other issue I have is also small but it's the microtransaction with the loot boxes. I'm never a big fan to see microtransaction in a paid game, I kind of wish that they did their loot boxes similar to Battleborn's loot packs. You get coins at the end of a match and you can use those coins to purchase a loot box. Would of been better in my opinion.

Overall Overwatch is a great game, it might as well be known as Team Fortress 3. It's fun and easy to get into.… Expand"

Other modes are just capture points and just escort train. Honestly a huge rip off. Maps seem ok, but are unbalanced to the flying heros. Classes are broken since offence is basically useless and defence and tanks completely over power them in any 1v1. Some support have more dps then offence. The game is a huge mess, someone needs to completely rework the heros. Now ive played both tf2 and battleborn and shadowrun so i know how balanced hero shooters work.

10,XandWacky,"May 24, 2016",10,This has a LOT of differences when compared to TF2. This game is very diverse with all its characters. The maps are also really fun to play and the gameplay is amazing. It's a game I really didn't expect to get into playing but I did anyway. I'm glad I did.

12,Maxson,"May 24, 2016",8,"Definitely one of the best shooters this year. This game is really fun, especially with friends.

There are tons of little things, that really help this game feel alive. For example, characters standing near debris, slanted walls, etc will adjust their feet's physical location so that it makes sense, as in no one appears to just be floating. Equipment, hair, earrings, pretty much anything that would have physics when people move does. The sounds and animations are incredibly varied and smooth on every character, and mechanical parts move in an incredibly realistic way.

That being said the game is still in it's infancy stage of release. So the content, while they claim to be expanding soon, is pretty bare right now- even if all of the characters are varied and super fun to play.
There are some minor balance issues and matchmaker will probably see some improvements over time.

All in all, while resembling TF2 in a few ways (Route 66 map, the game mode types...) it's variety of enjoyable heroes, level of polish, price point with loads of free content promised over this summer, and the Blizzard IP behind it- Overwatch will only gain traction from here on out.… Expand"

I really commend Blizzard from staying away from this model for a number or reasons. Primarily, this filters out many trolls instantly.

The level of detail on mechanics of the game by Blizzard is hard to match by any other company. Each individual character feels absolutely polished and unique in their skillset. Movement and shooting are extremely smooth, which is paramount in a game such as this one.

Balance is fairly spot on. You will get many in game saying that Reinhardt is OP, but there's easy counters to him that will subsequently shut him down easily. Each character can be very strong in different scenarios, but there are definite counters to each. Torbjörn also comes to mind on defense. He is very strong if you continue to select characters and run into turret fire.

I think this game will start to really shine as people hit the level to go into competitive ranked play and will make for a very entertaining E-Sport.

Quick Positives:

+ Hard to master

Overwatch, a game that should currently be F2P, is leveraging its Blizzard name to sell. The game features 21 unique Heroes, which is the only Pro to the game. Between poor level design, normal game modes with no team death match, no support for current PC hardware, and extremely low replay ability, this game falls flat. After playing for over 10 hours, it is inherent that this game is missing so many features, settings, options, modes that would be normally found in any other current release title in regards to FPS. It takes a whole 10 min to see everything this game has to offer, and begin questioning while you are still playing. The Gamer community has left feedback since the first day of the Beta, in which Blizzard has completely ignored and/or created excuses for. An example is 21:9 support. A widely popular request, as it can be found in almost all other titles from 2015 forward. Blizzard says they do not have the time to add it to the game due to artistic work needing to be completed. However, they do have time to run a real expensive marketing campaign that ranges between comics, full motion videos, banners, and all sorts of other items that take away from the artists time. Furthermore, this 21:9 feature can be forced in to the game via a very simple ""hack"", which is solid proof that this feature can be supported very easily as it works flawlessly. Yet, Blizzard fails to respond to the community with anything that can be considered proper response. Secondly, the tick rate at which this game runs. It runs at 1/3 of what the MINIMUM should be in an FPS. Long story short, this makes your aiming inaccurate and destroys the entire concept of an online FPS. Nothing like being shot as you run around corners. Cheaters? Yep, Blizzard has no answer to those guys yet. While there will be cheaters in every game, they are running rampant in the games where nothing is being done, aka Overwatch. Lastly, micro-transactions. Something Blizzard kept quite on until launch (shady). While micro-transactions don't ruin this game, still kinda lame how you must pay more to get what you need, otherwise it is random. Remind me again as to what that initial payment went to?

Tl:Dr - avoid this game like the plauge… Expand"

Movement is fluid and fast, and the shooting is satsfying.

Heroes are really distinct and have their own personality and gameplay. No hero plays the same like another.  Also, since i have seen this online lately, disregard anyone who complains about hero balance and about cheesy tactics that are somehow ""unbeatable"". This is clearly a ""learn to play"" issue. I played the Beta a lot, and let me tell you, that balance is in a very good place, though could be improved even more. Everything has its counters.

While this game has only 12 maps right now, and it is repetitive, it manages to stay fun and interesting for a surprisingly long time. The main reason for this is that the game has immense depth under the casual-friendly appearence, it is one of those easy to learn but very hard to master games. There is always something new to try and learn. And the competitive aspect of the game will keep you coming for more.

The main downside of this game, is that if you have no friends to play with, you won't get nearly the same satisfaction with those who do have their own party. This game is heavily based around teamwork and tactics. You can still find success solo, of course, but will be more difficult.

Other than that, the game deserves its price. Totally recommended.… Expand"

Overwatch is a good game. However, it suffers from the myriad of issues that plagued its readily comparable predecessor, Team Fortress 2. The balancing tactic relies on ""making everybody strong"", and making everybody ""OP"" instead of attempting some skill-based balance. Where that design philosophy can work in MOBA's like Dota 2 and to an extent League of Legends, Blizzard drops the ball here.

Simply being on the attacking team puts you at an astounding disadvantage. There are no counters for abilities that make players invincible, nor a defending team composed for tanks. The first two minutes of the game revolve around getting the payload to the final point, and the rest is devoted to trying in vain to end the game.

Problems that existed in the beta have not been solved. What was brushed off as ""Oh it's just a beta release"" has become ""They've voluntarily and knowingly released this product for full price.""
