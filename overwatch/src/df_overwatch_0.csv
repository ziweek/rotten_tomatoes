Overall overwatch had great potential, you can see it in the mechanics, the story, and how well made the characters are. But you can also see that someone in Blizzard didn't give a **** to properly roll it out.
Playing the game is frustrating because everything relies on how involved your team is. and sometimes they literally don't give a **** Even in competitive mode.

I've played this game since release and I've seen so much of this crap that I'm honestly never going to touch it unless it's during an event.

Speaking of events,This game looks great and it feels great to play. The playstyle for each hero is unique and fun. However, what brings this game crashing down hard are the terrible, horrendous, garbage balancing issues and balancing decisions. I've played this game since release and I've seen so much of this crap that I'm honestly never going to touch it unless it's during an event.

Speaking of events, OWs' event gamemodes are braindead and boring and I've never played an event so boring before in my life. The only reason I will play this game during events is because of the hero skins. The art department for OverWatch does SO GOOD on their character designs and hero skins however it's wasted by the balancing issues this game has and the fact that the devs can never decide how they want their game. The overwatch devs will NEVER go out of their way to fix an issue as soon as possible. They always wait for the monthly balance patches, sometimes they wait longer to address a huge and glaring issue and who suffers from that? The players.

There's multiple reasons so many people no longer enjoy this game, there's multiple reasons why so many well known community members and pro players have left the game. Don't believe the whole ""Overwatch has 40 (or 50 or whatever the number is now) million players!"" No, Overwatch probably has 40 or 50 million accounts. Which is a big difference seeing as so many people have more than 1 account. Which brings me to the next problem.

Smurfs.

So many smurfs. People wanting to feel validated so they make a new account and trash lower skill players. Not to mention every patch (maybe not every patch but it feels like it to me) they nerf a hero into oblivion and buff a hero into OP status to take the nerfed heroes spot. It's crazy and this game is not fun. This game is the only game I've EVER been mad while playing. This game had so much potential but sadly the balancing team makes nothing but bad decisions (mostly, the Brig nerf was SO necessary but then again she shouldn't have been that strong anyways). The only thing I can recommend for what Blizzard is giving us is this: Save your money for something else.

TL:DR Smurfs, reworks, design decisions and so many freaking balancing issues makes this game a nightmare to play. Save your money.… Expand"

And well, I had fun. A large variety of characters to choose from, flaming with personality and uniqueness, each with their own story to which you can be exposed in a variety of ways. There are many maps that are justified plot-wise and they come with a vast collection of different modes, with ones exclusive to certain festivities. And of course, a lot of customisation options, but you can get your favourite skins without breaking a sweat just by playing the game, so that is a big plus.

The main issue with this game is balance. It's not even the main issue, it's THE issue. I'm aware of how this game looked like when it released, and it is puzzling why they introduced the gameplay changes they did. As of now, there are two ways to enjoy quick-play/competitive modes: a queue with role regulations, and a queue where you can play whoever you want. I like the idea of making this game a little bit less chaotic with defining three main roles, but it is not fun that you have to wait roughly 8 minutes every time you want to play the DPS role, considering that this role has more than half of the game's characters in it. And the non-restrictive queue does not help with that either, since even if you try to play your favourite character, if it is out of meta, you will get stomped pretty quickly by those abiding it. And we are talking about the main modes, which means this is mainly how the game is supposed to be played, so it really does lower the score for me. But all these are flaws that can be fixed and it seems that Blizzard is slowly starting to realise its mistakes, though for the results we will probably have to wait for some time.

If you haven't played this game yet, I recommend taking a few of your friends with you to try it out, since it still is a lot of fun and the price right now isn't too high. But for now, I recommend you stick to those non-competitive quirky modes, where people generally try to enjoy the game.… Expand"

Los gráficos, sonidos y valores generales de producción son increíbles. El juego es muy pulido, y funciona increíblemente bien incluso en hardware de muy baja potencia.

El movimiento es fluido y rápido, y el disparo es satsfying.

Los héroes son realmente distintos y tienen su propia personalidad y jugabilidad. Ningún héroe juega igual que otro. Además, ya que he visto esto en línea últimamente, descuida a cualquiera que se queje del equilibrio de héroes y de las tácticas cursis que de alguna manera son ""inmejorables"". Esto es claramente un problema de ""aprender a jugar"". Jugué mucho la Beta, y déjame decirte, que el equilibrio está en un muy buen lugar, aunque podría mejorarse aún más. Todo tiene sus contadores.

Mientras que este juego tiene sólo 12 mapas en este momento, y es repetitivo, se las arregla para mantenerse divertido e interesante durante un tiempo sorprendentemente largo. La razón principal de esto es que el juego tiene una profundidad inmensa bajo la apariencia casual-amistosa, es uno de esos juegos fáciles de aprender pero muy difíciles de dominar. Hemos detectado un problema desconocido. Y el aspecto competitivo del juego te mantendrá viniendo por más.

La principal desventaja de este juego, es que si no tienes amigos con los que jugar, no obtendrás casi la misma satisfacción con aquellos que tienen su propia fiesta.

1. Role Queue
Since it got released I never played dps because waiting 20 minutes for a queue is just a no no so I always play a healer and most times it's just dps moira, because I wanna dps

2. Placements
Playing as a healer to get the best placement possible then on the 10th game someone from your team quits and you get a loss and it counts as a part of the placements and you get 2300 rank matchmaked with horrible noobs forever because the matchmaking system is the worst.

3. Worst matchmaking system
Get an awesome cooperative team then get the worst team or the one player that sabotages the match.
Means you can never really progress through the 3000 barrier even if you carry your team every game.

Competitive Gameplay: Due to role-queue, the queue times are inconsistent, with tanks and supports waiting 2-4 minutes for a match, and DPS waiting anywhere from 7 to 15 minutes for a match, depending on rank. Balancing is usually bad, but at the current time of this review, I think all heroes are viable. The actual gamemode of Competitive itself is functional, with a SR system which does a good job at showing a player's skill, but isn't very deep. I think every match does feel winnable, and matches in Overwatch tend to be more balanced (player-wise) than matches in other competitive games I have played. The devs have also been making changes which makes the future of competitive more hopeful.
6/10

Story: Overwatch has a promising story with many characters that many people want to learn more about. The bad part however, is that the game has been out for 4 years and the story hasn't developed far. It seems that most story that we are given is just backstory for new characters. Many characters have not been fleshed out, and in some cases characters have been downgraded. Ex: In the early days of the game, it was hinted that Mercy caused Reaper's condition because he was a botched experiment of hers, this would have made Mercy much more interesting, but it was retconned when Moira was released, and the animated short that showed her backstory shows that Reaper was a result of her evil experimenting. Another problem with the story is that it is too basic. the members of Overwatch are all saints with no bad qualities, and almost all the members of Talon (the evil organisation) are evil with no redeeming values, the only exception to this is Doomfist, who is evil but has an interesting motivation behind his actions. adding on to the basic story, it feels too 'clean and happy', as the good guys win every situation they're in, and nothing ever has weight.
3/10

Community: From what I've seen online, the community seems welcoming, and does occasionally make some good art based on the game (both drawings and videos). However many forums for the game are filled with the same boring highlights of gameplay, and stupid ideas for designing the game.
The n0rp is stellar tho.
7/10

Small Features: Events were a nice addition to the game, but every year they just repeat with little to no changes. Challenges were a good idea, but every single ""challenge"" is just win 9 games to get a skin.
Skins in the game are very well designed, and interesting. the only problem is that there are much more ""legendary"" skins than ""common"" skins which makes them have less value imo. Emotes and other cosmetics are also neat, and when they have a ""legendary"" status it feels deserved. The U.I is functional and is unique, so that's pretty neat.
6/10

Esports: The game has an Esports scene that will last a long time, but it does have some problems with stability. Many players and teams have left, but new ones always take their place. It will never die, but its identity is uncertain. The game does have nice integrations with the esports scene tho, with lots of skins to rep the teams, and a replay mode for re-watching matches. The Esports scene often sticks with one meta for a few months at a time, so it can get boring at times, but every meta can still be interesting if the players pop-off.

In a nutshell, Overwatch is a competitive team-based shooter that presents you with very compelling and addicting gameplay at first, but then eventually, sooner or later, wears thin and becomes more of a game that's not forRetired healer who has consistently played at a decently high competitive level (Masters) for many years across many seasons, clocking in at least 600 hours overall.

In a nutshell, Overwatch is a competitive team-based shooter that presents you with very compelling and addicting gameplay at first, but then eventually, sooner or later, wears thin and becomes more of a game that's not for fun but to feed your unceasing addition to it. (Or because you fall for the trap of ""I want to climb higher in competitive mode and I refuse to give up."")

Over my experience, Overwatch's potentially rewarding gameplay is weighed down by the consequence of a perpetually increasing casual player population. That is, the number of players who become complacent or do not have the drive to win is continually increasing, and that has resulted in matches of skill being often converted into matches of ""flip a coin to see which team has the most committed players.""

Unlike other competitive games where you could potentially win a match all on your own through a sheer display of skill (aka carrying), Overwatch's carry potential is more or less entrusted to your damage dealers (aka DPS) while the other roles, tanking (defending the team) and healing, simply serve to provide them with a window to do so or to buy time during a defensive play.

As a DPS, you are always stressed with underperforming being the one who makes or breaks the match, and as a tank or healer, you are always stressed with having to do a lot of work for little reward. Since I was focused on healing, I got used to this feeling of ""backseat gaming"" where I could only do my part and then simply watch the rest of the match unfold. (Naturally, as a healer, you don't have as much of an influence on a match's outcome as the DPS does.)

Due to the vast population and variety of players, there is no guarantee whether you will get a team of five others who are actually playing at or above their rank. Moreover, there is always the possibility that a teammate might not have the will to win, is simply killing time, or in the worst case scenario, is joking around and not caring about the match. These frustrations add up over time, and everyone has a breaking point to how much they are willing to tolerate.

What ultimately led to my retirement after investing so much time and effort is primarily enjoyment. Overwatch was fun in the past when I could play with like-minded friends of similar or better skill. They would do their part and I would do mine, and there would be incredible synergy, which led to enthralling gameplay. However, as more and more of them began to quit (for similar reasons), having to team up with random players (who tend to be uncooperative) has made it difficult for me to build an emotional attachment and interest in those matches.

Additionally, I have grown tired of repeating the same actions over and over. It is akin to listening to your favourite songs repeatedly over the years. Perhaps you can enjoy them for one, two, three, maybe even four years. But eventually, you will reach a point where those songs will grow stale and lose its shine, and you will desire something fresh. That was my deciding factor for retiring from Overwatch: It was no longer a new experience.

Overall, Overwatch deserves an 8, simply because it does offer new blood to the competitive gaming spectrum, but only for a certain amount of time. It is relatively enjoyable up until you inevitably grow bored of it. To maximize your enjoyment and minimize your frustration, I highly suggest only playing with friends and not playing competitive on your own.… Expand"
