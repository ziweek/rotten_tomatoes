So I went back to TF2 and haven't regretted it for a moment.

Obviously, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I am surprised to find that some people think that the devs don't deserve 40€ (or according to some, no money at all) for this game simply because it's PvP and because of the low number of game modes. I don't know why it should be a set standard that every PvP game needs to be F2P or can only cost a certain amount of money.

In my opinion, the characters are well balanced and well designed, and the characters that need a slight nerf or buff are already in the process of being subject to that change. I love the diversity of their functions in the context of teamplay. I love the gameplay and the sound design. And after 40 hrs of playing this game, I have as much fun playing it now as I did when it was released only a few weeks ago.

Already now, I feel like I have gotten my money's worth and Blizzard did an extremely good job of delivering a new and addictive FPS experience for me. For anyone who's looking for a TF2-inspired FPS, I can recommend this game wholeheartedly.… Expand"

40$ for two game modesWith constant comparisons by the community to the glory days of Team Fortress 2, Overwatch scratches an itch long since ignored by the AAA development scene over the last decade. Perhaps the filling of this void is what gives Overwatch it's real charm. Yet it's comparison to the rest of the genre is it's biggest fault: It doesn't provide the value I'm looking for.

40$ for two game modes and few enough maps I've learned the layouts within 3 days of my purchase doesn't exactly incite confidence in my wallet, especially with the number of unlockables (all purely cosmetic of course) stuck behind what is essentially a randomized paywall.

For me, the fun comes not from the gameplay itself, but because it's the first game in years to manage to bring all of my friends together in one place after the moba genre split it apart. Crediting it for that reunion would bolster the score far higher than the game deserves.

The characters are where the real focal point of the game and it's design lies, however the style of gameplay is what I would describe as mindless, and Blizzard's focus on trying to make sure everybody feels useful is horribly apparent throughout the game, going so far as to detract from any feeling of accomplishment I would get from actually performing well in game. Characters are constantly full of abilities that reward the player with eliminations solely for managing just to activate them while facing in the right direction. Eliminations are awarded regardless of damage dealt, with no differentiating in game between kills and assists. The showcased ""play of the game"" system will 90% of the time showcase a single ability use rather than showcasing a player that would actively demonstrate any real skill and game sense.

It's accessibility is what I think is going to keep me playing for a good while however, with games being short enough that I can hop in for a few whenever I have a spare half hour without any worries, and I think that's a truly valuable experience to have especially with friends. I can't knock the game for it's community but if you plan to get anything out of this beyond the initial launch period it will be imperative that you find yourself a core group in order to achieve any sort of depth or strategy.… Expand"

18,Chipzz,"Jun  8, 2016",8,"I don't normally write reviews for games but after reading some of the negative reviews as well as some of the perfect rated reviews I felt the need to write my own.

So what do you get with Overwatch? With Overwatch you get a very well put together, polished, fun to play game that could have been a perfect rated game if not for a few missing pieces. I will start by listing the positivesI don't normally write reviews for games but after reading some of the negative reviews as well as some of the perfect rated reviews I felt the need to write my own.

So what do you get with Overwatch? With Overwatch you get a very well put together, polished, fun to play game that could have been a perfect rated game if not for a few missing pieces. I will start by listing the positives followed by the negatives.

Positives:

-The game plays amazing. Everything about the games actually gameplay is perfect. The game plays really smooth. None of the very unique characters feel hard to control or awkward. Yes some characters are more powerful than others but the ability to change characters in mid game allows you to counter whatever mismatch your opponent throws at you. Most people who are calling one character or another OP are simply not educated on how to play the characters that counter that one. In all honesty if I see a player rolling with one of the popular ""OP"" characters it makes me grin because chances are they only know how to play that character and will be helpless when I counter them.

- Playing with friends is a blast. Obviously this applies to almost any game but Overwatch is just a blast to play with friends. This game is chalked full of strategy and those hilarious random moments that make for an awesome laugh with a team of friends. Like others have said yes you sometimes run into that stubborn random who picks a character that doesn't fit your teams needs but for me at least that has been rare. Others mentioned that most games are blowouts one way or another but I would actually say the opposite. I have easily had more games that come down to the wire making for some epic clutch moments.

- More content is on the horizon and will be free. While I could mark the lack of maps/game modes as a negative I won't simply for the fact that Blizzard is saying they are dedicated to growing this game through free content. It's my belief that they watched so many recent games have terrible launches and decided to hold back content on launch to avoid that (the game did launch very smooth). Although it lacks content in maps and game mods though the 21 characters at launch is a big number especially with how unique they are.

Negatives :

-There is no story mode. Obviously you have heard this already. Normally I wouldn't really care about this in a FPS. The only FPS I have actually played the story for is Halo. However with Overwatch this bothers me because the characters are so well made it makes you want something more. You want to know more about them, you want to play a campaign with them. They have released little bits of story but frankly it's not enough for a fully priced game.

- Loot boxes are terrible and this whole new trend of gaming just needs to stop. I 100% support the idea of having cosmetic items that you can purchase for your character if you want to. However those items should also be unlocked by grinding or completing an achievement. Then to make matters worse you are not actually spending money on the stuff you want. You are spending money on a box that contains a slight chance of giving the items you want. I could even get behind the idea of loot boxes if I at least got to pick a character specific loot box that then gives random items for that character. Why would I pay money to get a loot box full of stuff for characters I don't like? Unfortunately I don't see any change coming to this. There are just too many people willing to pay for Blizzard to pull out of this money scheme.

In closing it absolutely baffles me that people claim this game should be free. The game could be rated a 10 on the gameplay alone but the lack of a story and the micro transactions have to bring it down a few.… Expand"

So the playable part is very nice.

Lore and characters. Well, for people who like to know about the characters and their stories, it's obviously that they can to know it. However, the number of characters is reduced so options are too. But what I could say, they are charismatic and have interesting skills which can be countered if you know how to do it.

Graphics: Meh, it's Blizzard, you know. The game is attractive as hell.

Duration: We'll see, but in terms of fun, you'll have at least 80 to 100 hours of playing by the time (at this moment the game has no competitive mode and that sucks, but it will eventually arrive)

Price: And this is the point because I can't give it an 9 or 10... For that quantity of content, I think 40€ is a very expensive price. But whatever, if people can pay that AND don't have another game to replace Overwatch.. do it.

The good thing is that Overwatch will be updated periodically (or at least it's supposed to be) and this includes that the content will be expanded, in order to give the game more life, just as MMOs and others do.… Expand"

- Gameplay is awesome, neither hardcore or casual players get frustrated since team composition is required and encouraged naturally
- Sound design is intelligent!
- This game's marketing campaign and media released content has to be praised, it was massive! Hype was real for thousands of people (and we all know that hype sells even bad games). This may be the reason for low user scores though, because hype is often the cause of unrealistic or impatient expectations.
- Many reviewers are too extreme and gave this game low scores... if this game was a 0, then those really bad games or those that are corporate scams (pay to win, DLC story mode, gameplay affecting microtransactions, unbalanced fights, etc) need a new measuring scale.
- The price was adapted here, making me able to buy it. In my case, I live in a country where games are really expensive and take a large portion of the average salary... this game was kind of expensive, but I payed only $8 more than what I payed for Rocket League (RL is actually $20).
- I've already spent 22 hours playing Overwatch, which is more than what it took me to finish Far Cry 3 (a full priced game, with non farovable currency adaptation here, it costed around 1/10 of my wage). And I consider myself a casual player (have to work on weekdays and also take care of my home first)
- Developers are not ignoring what the community says, I've only seen this coming from indie developers in the past.

Cons: You have already read most important ones from the rest of the reviews and from angry gamers;
- Progression system could be better (we are waiting for Ranked Mode)
- Price is high, I know I praised the conversion here, but globally it is (not a single close friend or coworker bought it, only friends from other countries did). Bad reviews are not deserved and do not help into this matter.
- Game needs more skins variety, as well as some fun clothing accesories (Hats!)

That's all... An 8/10 with chances to become a 10/10.
A childish and unmature 10/10 here on Metacritic because ridiculously low scores are also childish and unfair.… Expand"

Overwatch itself is pretty nice, it all depends of the player-style. Some people might find it boring after some rounds, but others (who are more in a competitive way) will really enjoy the experience. Play it with friends, and it will be a much better experience.
The graphics are totally awesome and the gameplay it pretty nice, too.
The only downside of the game, imo, is just the lack of a single player campaign, just because I really like to be more involved in the plot. But that's fine, since Blizzard has made some great comics and videos to give us more of the story's background. Really recommend it.… Expand"

Before you had to have reflexes like a mongoose to get a kill or calculate the Coriolis effect when firing? When shooters actually were ""casual"" and for all skill levels, rather than a group of elitist jerks with too much time on their hands? When it was about up close-up mayhem and carnage rather drawn out sniping duels over miles of distance? Blizzard took a long, hard look at the state of shooters and had the courage to throw out the tropes and do something new. Yes, Overwatch borrows ideas and concepts from other shooters and games but Blizzard puts their own spin on them polishes them to brilliant sparkling gems. I haven't had this fun in a shooter for ages and it takes me back to the early days of Quake, Half-Life and Unreal Tournament, it's mayhem at it's finest. It's beautiful, polished and oh so much fun. Two thumbs up!

Update! After reading some of the negative reviews here I thought I'd adress some of the, in my opinion, unfair and whiny complaints.

THERE IS NO SINGLE PLAYER!

Blizzard made it very clear from the start that this was a multiplayer game ONLY so whining about single player makes no sense at all. That's like going to an Indian restaurant and then complaining that they don't serve Italian food.

THERE IS NOT ENOUGH CONTENT!

What? 21 superbly crafted characters, 12 maps and four game modes is not enough? I'm sorry, I'll take a highly polished gem over a dinosaur-sized turd any time of the day. Quantity does not equal quality. Also, remember when TF2 was released? It only had 3 game modes, 6 maps and still only has 10 characters.

THE GAME IS UNBALANCED!

Not it's not. Granted, a character might need a minor tweak here and there but for the most part I'm astounded how balanced the characters are. However, one of the core concepts of this ""rock-paper-scissors""-game is that you must change character as needed during a match and a team must have a balanced composition. Only offense characters in your team with no tank, healer or defense? You don't want to change character from your precious Reaper/? Then expect get beaten, often and thoroughly and you deserve it.

MATCHMAKING IS BROKEN

No it's not.  And no, there is no Blizzard conspiracy to keep you at a 50/50 win/loss ratio. Game Director Jeff Kaplan addressed most of these complaints in the Blizzard forum and they turned out to be nothing but conspiracy theories and hot air. Remember, level does not equal skill.… Expand"

Titanfall had an effective online story campaign in which ending scenes depended on who won the match for that scenario. Titanfall doesn't have the character appeal of Overwatch, which baffles me that there isn't a story mode at all for Overwatch.

Overwatch feels like an updated version of Team Fortress 2 with Smash Attacks borrowed from the Smash Brothers, and skills you can use reminiscent of a MOBA. They integrate all of the abilities seamlessly, and it works so well that it's currently holding the entire game together.

Overwatch is a good team-based FPS, but for it's own longevity it simply needs more content to explore.… Expand"

I see a lot of people complain about the lack of competitive modes or complaining that the game should be F2P. competitive is coming and the idea that is should be F2P is just absurd, yeah there aren't very many maps yet, but Blizzard has stated that all future content will be free. I also have no idea why some people are complaining about ""micro-transactions"" the only thing that would qualify in this game is buying loot crates, which would be dumb of you anyway since you will literally get 99 free crates just by playing the game and by then you'd have enough in-game currency to get anything else that you really want. I should also mention that the only thing you get from loot crates is cosmetic items. That's it, it's not like TF2 where you PAY to open a crate in hopes of getting an arguably better weapon.

It's fun with friends in short bursts. But, if you plan on playing by yourself or for a prolonged length, prepared to get frustrated and bored.

One of the few things that isn't pointed out much in other reviews is the horrid hitbox and tickrate that this games net-code utilizes. The game seems to favor the player with the higher ping (As sort of a 'benefit-of-the-doubt mechanic, I suppose), where... so long as they were on your screen at the time you attacked, they will be hit. So, there will be many times you'll scream in frustraition because you've backed around a corner, and still end up dead because the gunfire still manages to somehow make contact. It's very evident on Roadhogs chain-pull because in many situations, you'll find yourself glitch through the environment. But, you can also see it occur in many game-highlights where the game will snap the players view around to account for tick (making it appear as though your opponent is cheating via aimhacks, when-in-fact, they aren't... the netcode is just that terrible).

That, coupled with the community's current trend of hanging on to characters with broken or easily abusable skills ends up making this game extremely frustrating a large part of the time you're playing.

I really don't have a problem with cosmetic microtransactions since they hardly affect gameplay. However, the RNG system can be pretty crossing if you're looking for a specific character skin or animation.… Expand"
38,SaviourI,"Jun  6, 2016",9,"I'll start by saying this is the most FUN I've had playing a game in many years. It reminds me the days I used to play Super Smash Brothers 64, or the first year I played league of legends. I'm 60+ hours in, and I'm still having an amazing time. I believe i'll still be playing this on into 2017. Here's why:

It reminds me the days I used to play Super Smash Brothers 64, or the first year I played league of legends. I'm 60+ hours in, and I'm still having an amazing time. I believe i'll still be playing this on into 2017. Here's why:

A lot of people writing these reviews are giving this game poor ratings simply because they want a niche competitive shooter where they don't have to rely on teammates to win, and they can ""main"" any character a pull off a victory. If you're looking for a game like that, then obviously overwatch is not for you. You do need to work with your team to achieve victory, and you'll have to play lots of different characters along the way. This may sound like a bad thing, and it would be if all the characters were not so interesting and fun to play.

The beauty of Overwatch is that it IS still fun even when you are not winning. This may be due to the fact that the game is very new and that I have not played enough matches so that I require myself to win in order to feel the gratification needed to feel like I'm having fun. (as so many people do)

Overwatch was made with the casual gamer in mind, so you can be successful at this game even if you've never played a shooter before. Pick up a support like Mercy, or a defense character like Mei. Both require very little skill and can have a huge impact on a game. For offense, try Reaper, or Soldier 76. Again, both require little skill. This doesn't mean that Overwatch is simply about being easy.

If you're looking for a more challenging experience, you could always try characters like genji and hanzo, both of whom require a great amount time to understand and appreciate, and will never truly be mastered. It is especially rewarding to play these characters since you can feel more accomplished in making a big play with them because you know it requires more skill.

Matches are generally very short if they are one-sided, so if you're being crushed by the enemy team you know it will be a quick game, but if it's a close game they are usually very intense and can last a long time. This ensures you are rarely 'stuck' in a bad game for very long, and spend more time in the 'good' games.

Another thing I love about this game is how little down time there is between matches. I've rarely had to spend more than a minute between matches, and on average I spend about 5-10 seconds between one game ending and the next game loading up for me to pick my hero. This is huge for those who play moba's, (I played both league and heroes of the storm) where down time between games could average about 10 minutes, which got agonizing for me. It's a really nice change of pace.

What about the cost? Is 40 dollars too much for a game like this? I would say no, but I could understand why some would say yes. Many want to keep pushing games being free to play, but it's ridiculous for us to expect no investment on our part when these big companies put in millions of dollars of investment on theirs. Overwatch will continuously be updated for free. Free new characters, maps, and modes. All you have to is drop that initial 40 dollars on it, and you have game that will entertain you for the next year. (at least)

What about microtransactions? How do they affect the game? They don't at all. Microtransactions are only for buying cosmetic items. You have no reason to spend any more money on this game unless you simply gotta have something cosmetic that makes your favorite character even cooler.

There are some negatives to this game:

There is pretty much no story in game, since there is no single player campaign or co-op mode exploring characters background. For some people this may be a deal breaker, but who's to say that such will not exist in future patches.

There are only 2 game modes right now. Another thing that could be fixed in the future.

Summary: Overwatch can be enjoyed by anyone. Casual gamers will love how easy it is to get into and have fun. Hardcore gamers will love the challenge certain characters bring, and the reward of playing them well. (I respect anyone who can play hanzo and genji well) It's a game that's only gonna get better with time, as new characters, maps, and modes are promised for free. As far as arena based shooters are concerned, Overwatch can't be beat.

Pro's:
+ Lots of different characters to play of all different skill levels
+ Gorgeous graphics, sound, and atmosphere
+ Very little downtime between matches
+ Once you've both the game you don't need to spend any more money
+ Free updates planned for the future ensures game will be fun for a long time at no cost

Cons:
- No story in game, only multiplayer (no single player campaign, co-op mode, or anything of that nature)
- Only 2 game modes (Payload, point capture)

I went into this game excited by the style and variety of heroes. I was not left completely disappointing as the animation of the characters is stunning, and at times the game can be pretty fun.

The unfortunate thing about this game is it feels terribly unfinished for a 40-60 dollar game. There are so few maps, like 3 game-types, and although there are 20+ heroes, there really isn't any way to customize their play-styles.

The game is a full price game with the most disgusting F2P micro-transaction system I've seen in a game (crates drop when you level up, no other way to receive in game currency or crates even though you already spent full price on it).

Another issue is characters are just terribly unbalanced. I play D'Va personally and find myself switching to junkrat and demolishing (literally) the opposing team considerably, and this is due to a terrible lack of damage, and very little thought to her ultra (with that being said her E attack can be pretty useful when timed correctly). Character like MCree will just need to see your team and instantly gun them all down from any distance thanks to his ultra, and Hanzo's insanely cheap through the wall arrow shot is sure to hit a few people as well. D'Va's ultra is composed of a big shiny mecha catching anybodies field of vision, giving five+ seconds before blowing up, and giving everybody plenty of time to find cover.

The rubber-banding issues are insane, and I've had blizzards servers crap out on me a total of 3 times so far. If your looking for a good hero shooter with a decent f2p model, look no further than Dirty Bomb. At least Loot Cases drop after matches, heroes while not perfectly balanced are far more balanced than Overwatch, and the shooting mechanics don't feel like a tacked on afterthought.

I really wanted to love overwatch, but instead I'm left dissapointed at a Beautiful, yet overprice, overhyped, and under-balanced product. Had this been free to play or even maybe 15$ or less, maybe I'd not feel quite as strongly as I do, but until Blizzard gets it together I really have nothing better to say for them.

TLDR: If you love Moba's but wish they played more like a shooter then Overwatch might be for you, if you want a great hero shooter however don't make the same mistake I did and avoid this one like the bubonic plague, and hop on Dirty Bomb.… Expand"

Someone leaving basically gauntness victory for the other team, and joining a game where a team was one player down for a few minutes is no fun either. There do't seem to be any penalties for leaving, and as far as I can tell its actually encouraged in some places. If a friend invites you to play while you are in a game, a message comes up on your screen inviting you. If you accept you abandon the current game and join a lobby with your friend, screwing over your teammates from that match as they are now down a player.

Other than that, the game modes and maps aren't super special but it is still a pretty fun game to hop into every now and then and blow off some steam.

So when you join a game where your team refuses to work together (whether through character roles or just playing together) not only will you lose, but you won't even have fun. You will start to dread playing solo.

And then you play as a pre-made group with communication and all of a sudden, this is an awesome game! You're having fun, you're winning and losing games, and before you know it, 4 hours have passed and you're wondering where the time went.

But like anything, you'll remember the negatives more than the positives. I can't recommend this game to people who don't have a dedicated group already. Solo matchmaking is a gamble you'll more often lose, and winning doesn't even feel that rewarding anyways.

As many other reviewers have said, this is a multiplayer-only game. The big issue and the elephant in the room is the pricing of the game. I really do not feel I received in fun the $40 I invested in the game; further, Blizzard disrespectfully decided not to refund the purchase even though I bought the game a day before.

Despite the graphics, sound, and game-play, Overwatch is a lacking game in matters of:
-Story: (giving a short background for every character in a Multiplayer-only game is as useful as waiting for a shoe to sing).

-Matchmaking: I understand this feature will be added in the near future, but the fact is that this aspect should have been done before the game was made public.

-Campaign: This would give light to the story behind each character, and I hope they bring it in the future (for free)

In short, Overwatch is a BETA game released to the public as a whole game for $40 or more. For the playable contents of the game it deserves an 8.0. However, since half of the game is non existent, I will give it a 4.0. The fair price for this game is not $40-$60. It should be $20-30.… Expand"

On the one hand, the goofy characters and frenetic gameplay lead to some good experiences where you have fun. On the other hand, the game lacks any sort of serious depth and I struggle to play it for hours at a time like I did with Team Fortress 2.

Instead of having different loadouts like Team Fortress 2, Overwatch deigns to have many more characters with different abilities which more or less takes the place of the different weapons from TF2. This is fine and it does a great job of making each character unique, but many of the abilities have some serious flaws. Many ultimate abilities for example, can and will essentially destroy an entire enemy team with little counterplay. For example, one hero has an ultimate ability that will aim for you automatically as long as the opposing champions are on your screen. Another hero's ultimate ability automatically fires unavoidable damaging blasts at all hero's in a radius around him. These overpowering abilities detract from an otherwise enjoyable experience.

The lack of game modes and maps is also a concern. With only two game modes (Domination with a single point and a Payload-style mode), the game quickly becomes repetitive, exacerbated by the comically small amount of maps for a FPS (12 maps). The game is desperately in need of more content to justify the price tag.

By far the largest complaint I have, however, is how short matches are versus the time required to get back into a game. It is common to wait around 30 seconds to get into a match, then you spend another 60 seconds while everyone chooses their character, then you spend another 60 seconds while the defenders set up. At the end of the game, you spend around 30 seconds voting for the best team contributor, and another 30 seconds watching the ""play of the game."" This is in addition to any loading times while the game chooses the map or finds new players to fill a game after others have left. After all of this has occurred - the game has the potential to last just 5 minutes if a team struggles. At it's maximum, most games of Overwatch rarely last longer then 10 minutes. In my humble opinion, the best way to counter this is to introduce longer game-modes such as the popular ""tug of war"" style maps from Team Fortress 2.

Despite these flaws, Overwatch definitely has some charm, and it's easy to see the love put into the game - Blizzard are definitely masters at creating appealing games. The characters are likable enough and the maps are mostly satisfactory. It's a game that I tried very hard to love and in the end I found the experience simply ""OK"".

If you are looking for a successor to Team Fortress 2, the game fails to deliver a satisfying experience. I would recommend waiting for a sale before investing in this game, and I definitely would not recommend this game for folks who are easily frustrated.… Expand"

2. Not enough content - I can understand this complaint...at the moment. It is a little light on modes/maps. But, I see this as an investment - I trust that Blizzard will deliver with more characters, modes, and maps in the future. If you can't make that gamble, then I guess you won't be playing the game.

3. It should be free to play (F2P) - Couple reasons that I'm glad it isn't: 1) prevents bots/hackers from flooding the game (this is huge), and 2) in this team-based class shooter, I don't know how you could have a 'free' hero rotation. You would see the same heroes in every game and that would limit the team comps drastically. It would also cause this game to be pay to win, as a team that has all the heroes available vs. a team that doesn't would have a HUGE advantage.

Now, with that over, I want to tell you what I like and don't like about the game:

PROS:
- Gameplay is fantastic. Fan. Tas. Tic. After all, this is what make a game actually fun to play, and this game has it in spades.
- It runs great. Granted, I have a nice system, so I wasn't worried at all, but even so, I haven't had a single issue with them game. I also have run it on my older system and it played great on that one, too.
- Character design is amazing. I can't stress enough to people that haven't played how unique each of the characters are in this game. Everyone excels at different styles of play and none of them feel like they overlap. It's really astonishing how they pulled that off.
- It's a Blizzard game. What I mean by that is Blizzard has a knack for knowing how to keep a community going, so I have full faith that this game will be going strong two years down the line (and probably longer).

CONS:
- Loot boxes. I don't mind loot boxes, in general, but I do think I should be able to ""trade"" a skin for another skin of the same rarity. Or, at least, let me cash in skins to buy the skin that actually want, even if I don't get full value for the traded-in skins. Right now, the only way to get credits to get them randomly in loot boxes and for duplicate items (again, randomly in loot boxes).
- This isn't a real con, as it can be overcome with a good comp and coordinated team, but in general, teams on defense have a distinct advantage. I have a feeling this won't be as much of an issue when ranked play comes out, as players will focus more on the objectives than running off and trying to rack up solo kills (hopefully).

Overall: I really enjoy this game. I don't come from an FPS background. In fact, I will say I don't play FPS at all. But this game allows me to jump in and contribute in a support role and makes it very fun to do so, at the same time. I would recommend anyone playing this game - even if you don't play shooters.. In the 20+ hours that I've played so far, I can say that I've never had this much fun in an online competitive game.

The best/worst part about this game is that it has that ""just one more match"" hook. It melts away the hours and when you're not playing it, all you can think about is when you can play it again. Between this and Rocket League, I might never play another game again.… Expand"

I'm having a lot of fun playing with my friends, even when we're losing horribly.

That said there are some cons.

First of all this is a team oriented game that relies heavily on teamwork, so it can get a bit boring and frustrating if you aren't playing with a group of friends. Random teams just have random results so you're better off with friends.

Second is the lack of a solo campaign. With Blizzard's incredible world building, with backgrounds for each character and INCREDIBLE animated shorts it feels like there is more to this game then there actually is... and I could understand that some people might have initially thought there was more to it.
All this lore is actually developed for the IP in the whole that they may or may not get into with games or DLC further down the road.

Third is a.. semi-con. Collectables and loot boxes or rather how they work.
Blizzard has a way of tapping into the completionist in many of us. They do it in pretty much all their games, a reason why some refer to blizzard games as digital crack.

Every time you level up you get a lootbox... which has a chance of giving you a few items, which can be skins, intro animations, character emotes, sprays, player icons and voice lines. These lootboxes can also be bought in-game via blizzard's store.

While opening these boxes give you that exciting uncertainty of what you'll get.. it's COMPLETELY RANDOM. This means that, potentially, you could open a great deal of boxes and only get sprays, icons and voice lines and perhaps some currency while you really just wanted that one legendary skin for that once character you love to play.

Also, while legendary skins cost 1000 ingame currency to unlock, if a lootbox happens to contain a skin you already have, it will only award you 200 currency.

I could go on and on about this but lets just say that the RNG is strong in thisone. For some this turns out gloriously and for others it's a random generated nightmare.

those are my 2cts on the game. Overall I give it a 8... a solo campaign would probably make this game a 9 or even a 10. I can't wait to see what Blizzard does next with this new franchise, there's a lot of potential.… Expand"

Plus, Blizzard has said that everything that is added to the game from here on will be free (granted that might change, but I doubt it). So I would say, think of it as a long term investment where all you do is pay $40 up front, get eight maps, 4 game modes, and 21 unique heroes. To put that in perspective, $40 in a MOBA like League of Legends gets you maybe half that many characters, with only one map and game mode. So yes, Overwatch costs money for what doesn't seem like a lot of content. But compared to how much some people will spend in a supposedly Free-to-Play game, and especially compared to games that continue to charge you for new content, it's a great deal, and I believe it's a great investment, as well.

Now, onto the part most people actually give a crap about: The gameplay. Every hero is unique in how they're played, and every character has their role to play. There are six Offense heroes, who are mostly fast and intended for close range combat, six Defense heroes, designed to remain in advantageous positions and prevent the enemy from taking their objective, five Tanks which have high health and defense (at the cost of lower attack) that are designed to soak up damage and protect their teammates, and four Support heroes which are designed to keep their allies alive and their enemies at a disadvantage. Some Heroes are a little more difficult to get the hang of than others, as they require quick reflexes, precision aiming, excellent timing, or prior planning if escape is needed.

I could go into further detail about powers and weapons, but that'd take up more time than is necessary, so I won't. But the gameplay is solid and most of the characters are balanced (a couple of the tanks do more damage than they should, and some Ultimates are a little underpowered), and the game modes, while limited to four different types (payload escort, objective capture, king of the hill, and objective capture w/ payload escort) are all really fun, and so far every game I've played has been incredibly intense. No single player story, but really, what kind of story could you have for a game like this, anyways?

On top of solid gameplay and interesting heroes, the game looks really nice, everything is nicely polished and the art style is very pleasant to look at.Not much else I can put on top of that, it just looks great.

Pros - The game comes with all characters unlocked. They are very nice creations and look amazing. Each individual character comes with their own play style and perks allowing team creation. I have yet to find a significantly overpowered character, so balancing seems fine.

Cons - The game comes with all characters unlocked. The use of special powers leaves a lot of characters feeling slow and lumber some. The tanks feel as though they are fighting a losing battle as they have high Armour and extremely low attack (except for Rienhardt who is melee). There is zero customization for each individual character meaning you have no way of changing a characters play style.

Maps:

Pros - All the maps look and feel great. Depending on game type their will be around 4 maps you play on, making a lot of maps. The maps have a decent amount of vertical movement which helps break up play.

Cons - Even though there are a good number of maps the specific game mode to map make you feel as though you are fighting the same battle over and over again. A similar feeling to that of Battlefront walker assault (if you were suckered into buying that to for hype).

Scoring System:

Pros - The scoring system doesn't just focus on the sheer number of kills you made. It has separate focus on each character type preference, whether that be blocking damage or healing your team. Play of the game shows the 'best play of the game' instead of final kill.

Cons - The scoring sometimes focuses on players achievements which are pretty average while leaving out the real MVP's who carried the games. While the 'play of the game' is a great idea, it seems to rarely focus on the actual best play of the game. An example, I made two double kills in short succession then used my special for a 5th kill in the space of about 5 seconds. At the end game 'play of the game' someone killed a player and themselves. Feels a bit empty.

Loot System:

Pros - Good Looking Skins

Cons - Loot boxes are rubbish. They throw out loads of extras like tags that no one uses/wants and new voices that are generic. Every now and again you will receive a new skin. The skins are cool, but they are full body skins. This lowers the amount of customization and also the longevity of loot boxes as they are the only things worth winning. Also the majority of skins are just color copy's with each character having a couple of unique looks.

Overall game play:

Pros - Feel crisp and using the right power at the right time can be rewarding.

Cons - Messy. Can feel slow and a bit of a grind. Movement is sacrificed for specials so there is no option to dash out of danger if needed. This also becomes annoying after you die and have to run back across the map to get into the fight. Guns feel under powered. Overall the whole time you can be running around shooting at people and not make a single kill, Something I have not experienced before. Alternatively, you could be making a load of kills and not even know as the scoring is so bad.

Edit: Tick rate is really effecting game play. You will not realize the majority of the time that you are being shot at. This gives the impression that you are constantly one shot killed while not doing damage to anyone, until you see the kill cam and realize that you were being shot at for a huge amount of time. O Its almost a joke that is more funny than frustrating though.

Conclusion:

The game feels chunky and clunky. The fact that it focuses so strongly on team buildings means that individual casual player will always be at a huge disadvantage. No one in your team will want to be the healer and nine times out of ten you will find yourself in a game with all attackers. If you do have a good crew ready to play hopefully you have that mate who doesn't mind being the healer to follow you round while you rack up kill streaks.
Each game feels the same as the last on that specific map. Use the same strong points to resist attack over again or vice versa.
After a solid 30 hours really wanting this game to work it feels lacking and I have left feeling empty even through some of the best matches played.
I would not recommend this game to any FPS who enjoys the likes of COD, BF3/4, Insurgency, Rainbow Six Siege, or even DOOM or Unreal tournament. This game is a FPS MOBA and it takes away from the overall skill of the game.
The game is a gimmick and while feels great when first picked up, it quite quickly becomes boring and repetitive. For the price I may force myself through some more hours, but would recommend picking this up for a discount later down the line when bored of other your game… Expand"

84,rock5vat1,"Jun  2, 2016",0,Overwatch is a very enjoyable team shooter. The game is a perfect casual game where you can jump in for 5-10mins and shoot up some people. The characters are fun to play and I do love that the game tells you what your team comp is lacking or has too much of. A nice thing that other team games should put in.

One of the most annoying things though is that half the time I cant play my favorite characters because everybody just uses the offensive characters and go off and do their own thing. Sometimes your teammates don't even pick healers and you feel the need to pick a healer and your team ends up with 5 McCrees and 1 Mercy. Also the balance is good but there are a few OP characters IMO: Bastion, McCree, Lucio, Roadhog, and D.Va. As long as you have a good team though you can beat your enemies easily (Unless you're up against 6 McCrees, then your screwed). The MAIN problem though is the price. This game cost $40 dollars on PC and $60 on console. Not to mention there are microtransactions. The microtransactions are just for loot boxes which can give you character skins, voice lines, emotes, player icons. Also there are Overwatch points which you can ONLY GET FROM LOOT BOXES! You should be able to get these points from playing the game. You can get loot boxes from leveling up but that takes a long time and most of the time you just get useless sprays and crap. Hopefully Blizzard makes a better progression system because if you could purchase JUST overwatch points with real money I might actually spend money to get Explorer Winston. Also $60 and even $40 is just too much for what your getting. Its fun but I really think it should be $30 at most. The end.… Expand"

A ""shield guy"" can be combod with a ""turret guy"" and literally destroy anything in its path. The shield is too strong to destroy right away, and before you even get a chance the turret guy will kill you. Rinse and repeat. Always works. Bad. Game.

Then theres the cowboy guy thats currently overpowered. Hes so good right now that if you accidentally come withing 10-15 feet of him - you die. No need for why and how. You just die. Thats just bad design.

Then theres a lack of stuff to do. Almost all games are identical, and for a game thats supposed to last for months and months, maybe even years (TF2 9 years soon), Im finding myself bored of the content after just 2 days.

The loot is all cosmetic and VERY limited. Youre looking at a couple of re-colors (lazy developers) and tops 2 actual changed cosmetics on every character. Not a lot.

No, this game needs to be given a few years more of developing and fine tuning. If it were up to me Id completely rehaul the damage system. Right now you can literally die before you have a chance to react. Its not COD. Its worse than COD.… Expand"

But I can't.

First of all, the matchmaking!
Blizzard is notorious for their incompetent matchmakers. Heroes of the Storm was a huge failure because of it, despite HOTS having pretty damn awesome gameplay and design, the cancer that was matchmaking proved to be fatal to the game. One would think that the company learned from its mistakes. Nope. The game throws everyone together. Seasoned, highly skilled tryhards who are in it for the win and teamplay, and useless, noobcake newbies who will pick a 3rd sniper to cement your team's failuire. The teams are rarely ever balanced. One team usually stomps the other. Virtually every single game is full of frustration and stress. I tried to cling onto hope so hard that I gave the game more than 50 hours played hoping that the matchmaking will get a bit better, but nope, it didn't. To make things worse, there is no ranked play. Why would any developer release a competitive team based game without ranked play? That's the point of the whole game. It's like, selling a car without a motor: ""Here's your car, we don't have your motor yet, but in the meantime you can sit in it, or you can pretend to dive it!""

Did I mention high latency? In most online games I have 20-25 ms ping. In overwatch the lowest I've seen is 40-45, but it usually is 60-70.
The server communicates with the clients 20.8 times per second. So, everything you do in the game happens on that other guy's monitor about 0,1 seconds later. That's a lifetime in a fast paced FPS shooter! You will get shot by snipers and everybody all the time despite the fact that you were already in cover on your machine. It's a joke.

I played plenty of multiplayer FPS games in my life. I used to be a Quake1 player, touched Q3, Quake Live, the COD and Battlefield series, the UT series and so on, but those games were FUN. Overwatch has a much better gameplay, but the matchmaking nullifies every bit of that so hard that I have to arrive to the conclusion:

I never had such an awful online experience in my life.… Expand"

93,Mewthree,"Jun  2, 2016",8,"When you think about Blizzard, two words come into mind: polish and optimization. This is particularly true for Overwatch.

It's easy to miss how much work has gone into the polish and not give itWhen you think about Blizzard, two words come into mind: polish and optimization. This is particularly true for Overwatch. The game runs absolutely fantastically and the gameplay feels very satisfying, responsive and smooth. On top of that, the game has a lot of attention to detail with the maps, sounds and heroes. It's easy to miss how much work has gone into the polish and not give it the credit it deserves.

One of the best things about the game is its heroes. They are all so unique and very fun to play. I honestly don't dislike any of them. Some balancing still needs to be done, but the game is surprisingly balanced, considering it just came out. But I am a bit disappointed in the amount of mechanical skill required to play most of the heroes. Luckily, there's still a lot of skill involved in the game, strategic-wise. The heroes aren't the only thing that's expertly crafted, though. The map design is superb. Not once have I felt frustrated because of the maps during my 30 hours of playtime.

Unfortunately, there are some aspects of the game that are causing a great deal of controversy. First off, is the game worth $40? This really depends on your definition. If you look at the amount of content (btw, there's 3 game modes, not 2, and yes, although two of them appear to be similar, they play out very differently) and compare it to some other games, the price seems way too high. On the other hand, if you look at the amount of fun you're having and how many hours you can happily spend with the game, $40 feels like a bargain. In the end, it's everyone's own choice whether the game is worth it or not. That said, you do get all of the upcoming content for free when you have the game. This includes competitive mode (=ranked), new maps, game modes and heroes. Knowing Blizzard, there will be a lot of content and support coming from them, but we're essentially paying for content that's not (yet) there.

Nonetheless, it is absolutely mindless to give the game 0/10 because it is multiplayer only and doesn't have a lot of content. Look at CS:GO and LoL, for example. Not a lot of content there, but there's TONS of players who have thousands of hours spent in the game. Granted, the skill ceiling in Overwatch may not be quite as high, but the game is clearly designed to be an esport. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game.

The progression system is essentially about lootboxes that grant you skins, voice lines, sprays etc. I can see this not being to everyone's liking, but personally, I like it. It does seem like a F2P mechanic, especially with the micro-transactions, but contrary to some people's opinion, the game isn't a F2P game, nor should it be. Bear in mind that everything in the game is obtainable without real money AND you get all the heroes (including the upcoming ones) instantly for free. For the record, you can not buy anything that helps you in the game in any way. It's all just cosmetic.

In the end, the game is a lot of fun and it's very addicting. The amount of polish and detail is really impressive, but unfortunately we're paying for content that isn't yet there and the mechanical skill required is a bit underwhelming so I have to give it an 8/10. Still, I'd imagine that somewhere in the future, when more content has been released, the game might deserve a 9.… Expand"
