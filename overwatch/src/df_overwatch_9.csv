2,RipTide098,"Jun  1, 2016",8,"Overwatch is a fast paced, colorful, First Person Shooter, with a diverse cast of playable characters to play as.  The game is a lot of fun, but has a few glaring problems that keep it from being truly great.

Environment designsOverwatch is a fast paced, colorful, First Person Shooter, with a diverse cast of playable characters to play as.  The game is a lot of fun, but has a few glaring problems that keep it from being truly great.

The first thing to talk about is, the game just looks amazing. The fantastic art style and bright colors make every part of this game just stand out so well.  Environment designs have enough detail to make each area feel distinct and alive without feeling overly cluttered or distracting.  Character models look fantastic.  Each of the 21 characters look unique and yet are instantly recognizable at a glance, and every inch of them is bursting with character. In a world where games with muted grey brown as their only color have become the norm, it is nice to see colorful games that aren't afraid to be games again.

Gameplay is fast and fun.  The maps are very well designed with plenty of large open areas for ranged engagements and many side paths to flank and get the drop on opponents.  Even within the same map areas can feel wildly different, with one section being a wide open combat arena and the next being tight corridors, and the rest being anywhere in-between.  The heroes all stand out gameplay wise as well, with even characters that are considered to be of the same class playing completely different.  The diversity of skills and weapons available from the cast of heroes is enough to keep the game from ever feeling stale.  Some may complain about the lack of customization, but I for one, prefer the massive differences form class to class than the minor differences from load out to load out.

Now to the bad parts, the game is a little content light.  There are only three real different game types and a forth that is just a combination of two of the others.  There could have been a few more on launch, even just adding a fully fleshed out death match style game mode would have gone a long way to remove this as a concern.  Though to be fair the large roster of heroes does do a bit to cover for this, personally I would rather extra characters to an extra game mode or a few maps.

Now for my biggest problem with the game, the free to play style loot system.  The slow rate of gaining crates, the random factor ensuring you have virtually no chance for getting items you want, the high rate of duplicate items, and the low 20% of value credit gain from said duplicates all add up to make this system just terrible.  Even though all the items are purely cosmetic, this system is designed to trick people into spending more than they want to and does not in any way belong in a full price game.

Over all Overwatch is a fun game that looks great and is a joy to play.  Right now thought, it is held back by its lack of diversity in game modes and atrocious free to play loot system.  If you can wait for the additional free content that is coming, and can look past the free to play elements, it is defiantly worth the cost though.… Expand"

As general policy I don't like giving games (or anything) perfect scores because it discourages improvement, but the game as released has done an excellent job of what it set out to do. I'd like some more modes, and we'll get them eventually. My biggest gripe is there's no way to earn the in-game currency used to buy customization options for characters.

Well, after 5 hours of gameplay, and ranked up to 14, I can say that it is very entertaining.  I was a huge fan of Shadowrun on the Xbox 360.  In many ways, it was a predecessor to Overwatch: different classes, trolls that absorbed massive amounts of damage, nimble Elven samurai that could teleport through walls, dwarves with shotguns, and magic spells that would allow you to create thorned bushes.  But Shadowrun was abandoned when FASA shut down.

Overwatch does most of those things and a bit more.  It has highly detailed graphics that have personality.  The presentation of the character portraits have style.  Instead of the generic soldier with different upgradeable guns, you have to learn the gameplay mechanics of each character as if it were a fighting game.  You really need to work together if you want to win.  It does need a bit more variation in terms of game types, but I'm sure Blizzard will add those as time goes on.  The core gameplay is really fun and makes me miss Shadowrun a little bit less, which is a great thing.… Expand"

Hero Gallery: Everything you’ve unlocked for the characters in the game can be viewed here, from Colors to audio.

Loot box unlocking: In Overwatch you get loot boxes as your level raises to unlock colors, spray's, emotes, poses and voice clips to customize you chosen character with. If you don't want to slog threw unlocking through level up then you can buy loot boxes PSN.  The unlocks do nothing and are only for cosmetic purposes not to strengthen.

Story Mode: Yes the game has no story mode mostly because the characters stories and what Overwatch is explained in the cinematic movies on Youtube. Polygon recently made a timeline for the game on its site so you can probably find it on Google by typing Overwatch timeline.

Blizzard has confirmed all update content free as Blizzard stated in an interview with Ubergizmo.

14,Evidicus,"Jun  1, 2016",10,"With Overwatch, Blizzard does exactly what they do best.

Some will say that there's nothing new or innovative to be found here, and that the game essentially just takes the Team Fortress 2 formula mixes in a little MOBA flavor. While technically these people are correct,With Overwatch, Blizzard does exactly what they do best. They take an existing concept and refine it to a level of polish that most developers will never be able to match. Some will say that there's nothing new or innovative to be found here, and that the game essentially just takes the Team Fortress 2 formula mixes in a little MOBA flavor. While technically these people are correct, Overwatch is a game that proves that the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts.

Pros:
- The 21 heroes are all unique, interesting and fun to play. Even tanks and support classes, which are typically unpopular given that most FPS players just want to selfishly hunt for kills, are a lot of fun with interesting abilities. I especially appreciate that, regardless of your preferred play style or level of experience, there is a character that you can do well with. You don't have to be an exceptional FPS player to enjoy this game and contribute to your team. This is a good thing.

- The visual and audio design are incredible! I'm not just talking about the art style, which I think is fantastic, but I understand is subjective. What I'm referring to is the visual language and audio cues that the game has to tell you immediately what the heroes do, where the objectives are and what you should be doing. It only take a couple of matches to know that a specific enemy ultimate has been activated based purely on sound alone. The UI is informative, clean and gives you all of the information you need without being a distraction. Finally, the combat, heroes and maps are all colorful and bright without being garish or confusing. You may see a lot of bright effects in the middle of combat, but you know exactly what abilities those effects correspond to.

- The maps and modes are engaging and fun to play. While the modes are simplistic in terms of objectives, I think Blizzard was smart to keep it that way at launch. It still amazes me that despite the simplicity of the modes, how many players still ignore them and try to hunt for kills like a traditional FPS. Hopefully more complex and interesting modes will come along after the player base matures a bit and the begins to understand that objectives are more important than individual performance.  Where the maps really shine are the hidden paths that each contains to allow certain heroes with movement abilities to back cap objectives or avoid meat-grinder choke points. These paths are not immediately obvious, but once you learn them, it's incredibly rewarding.

- The hero interactions and how they compliment or counter each other, coupled with the ability to swap heroes on the fly, really make this game shine! If you're the kind of player who wants to come in and ""main"" a single hero, you'll probably be in for a bad time. But if you treat it like a MOBA and can master a handful of characters across each of the roles, then Overwatch will be a very enjoyable experience for you.

- Depth without complexity. People often confuse these as being the same thing, but they aren't. Overwatch is very simple to pick up and play, even with heroes you may have never tried before. But you'll constantly find new ways to use them based on your team, the enemy team and the map you're on.

- In game purchases are limited to cosmetic items only, and are completely optional. Don't care about them? Don't buy the loot boxes. You can earn them simply by playing the game. It's about as non-offensive as micro-transactions can be. If you don't care to purchase loot boxes, then don't. Buy the game once, and never pay another dime.

- 60 FPS at 1080 - even on consoles.

Cons:
- No single player. I personally don't think this is a huge deal, or even necessary. There are fantastic games that *only* have single player, and Overwatch is a fantastic game that *only* has multiplayer. The only reason I list is as a con is because the heroes are so great that I would love a campaign.

- Symmetra should really be a Defensive hero and not a Support. She doesn't heal, and her shields are not enough to really carry a team as a solo support. Her kit is really better aligned with the Defensive role, but again, this is a very minor and personal complaint.… Expand"

I had no interest in Overwatch for the many months that it was in Closed Beta, then the open beta came around and I gave it a whirl. I knew beforehand that it's a purely team-based pvp game with a diverse cast of ""heroes"" with a coupe of abilities. I had no idea how the game felt when played thou.

I was blown away, the responsiveness is great and it feels amazing, you feel in control of everything you do and when you fail you feel you could've done better and not blame the controls or mechanics.

The heroes are amazing, the character design and art style is stellar and all of it feels very polished (in true Blizzard style).

At launch you get 21 unique heroes on 12 maps with 2-4 game modes. I say 2-4 because there are basically only 2 game modes with slight variations that could be considered an extension to 4 game modes.

The game revolves around team play, all modes are centered around 6 vs 6 and coordinating with your team on the fly can be very rewarding. Naturally quick plays with random people can and will often end in disaster with a ""fluster cluck"" of people doing everything but what the objective is on the map.

The game also revolves around being able to change heroes on the fly every time you die in order to counter whatever your enemy team throws at you. There are some iffy plays such as 6 of the same heroes (yes you can have more than one of one type of hero in a team) that require an almost full team of hard counter heroes to pummel into non-existence and that can be difficult to agree on with a random array of players.

Each hero has a few abilities unique to them with an ""Ultimate"" skill that for many/most classes can turn the tables in a match if played out right. Very satisfying to pull of your skills just right and throw the ultimate just right (each ultimate is different and has its own role and synergy). Exploring the synergies between heroes makes for endless, potentially satisfying, plays that keep you going from match to match.
Speaking of matches, the extremely fast pace of the game makes for a very small average match time of about 7-9 minutes which is great and lets you get past that bitter defeat (that you will likely run into..) and move to another match.

Many reviews I've seen here from disgruntled users talk about how the game lacks content for the price point of 40/60 dollars (40 on pc, 60 on consoles). I was slightly inclined to agree when it dawned me that I actually consider it to have enough content for the 40 dollar price tag on pc at least.

Firstly the game was advertised as a purely competitive pvp experience and no pve, even thou the cinematic ""trailers"" could lead you to believe it might have....
The closed beta has been going on for ages and anyone interested in the game should have already known this, and what the game will launch with, this was common and basic info available to everyone.

Secondly, when people say ""I got bored of the same modes on the same 12 maps in a few hours"" I don't understand it, does a FIFA fan get bored of the same exact mode of play ? Does a CS player get bored ? This game is hugely varied by comparison to most competitive, no progression (no leveling, no items) games out there. I and, I assume, many like me, play for the situations I'm put in with my team mates. I'm trying various classes in various situations and having a blast.

One thing to note is that there is some alleged net code ""issues"" discussions floating around. Those are actually Blizzard's choice on how to approach the netcode of their game, weather it's the best choice or not remains to be seen and if needed I'm sure Blizzard will tweak it.

""TF2 is free and has more content"": TF2 hasn't always been free, I remember buying Orange Box twice specifically for TF2 (once on 360 and once on PC) and at that time the game had significally less content than Overwatch did at launch. Loadouts wasn't even a thing at that time (let alone hats) so it was much closer to how character picking in Overwatch is at its current state.

""This hero is OP and keeps one shotting me"": The overall balancing is fine with some very few exceptions (McCree and Widowmaker) but those two do still have counters. Character switching is strongly encouraged in the game simply because it works on a ""rock, paper, scissors"" system. Having problems with an enemy Widowmaker? Pick Winston, D.va, Genji, Hanzo or simply a mirror Widowmaker.

Albeit not as content rich as TF2 is at its current state, Overwatch has a lot of potential to grow. If you're looking for a ""new"" TF2 or just a fun team based shooter then you probably want to give this game a try.… Expand"
20,GadGamer,"Jun  1, 2016",9,The last 3 years of first person shooters pale in comparison to the last 3 days I have had with this game. I'm not going to say this game is a perfect gem by any means. There is still a lot that can be done in terms of adding game modes and maps to make the price point a little more reasonable but its current state is a great jumping off point for a game that could last years.
21,Captiosus,"May 31, 2016",7,"Based on my time in Closed and Open Beta along with a limited bit of time after launch, I initially gave the game a pretty favorable ""9"" rating. After a full week and slightly more than one full day of actual game time, my opinion has trended decidedly downward so I feel I must revise accordingly.

All one needs to know about Overwatch can be gleaned by looking at the in-game/Battle.netBased on my time in Closed and Open Beta along with a limited bit of time after launch, I initially gave the game a pretty favorable ""9"" rating. After a full week and slightly more than one full day of actual game time, my opinion has trended decidedly downward so I feel I must revise accordingly.

All one needs to know about Overwatch can be gleaned by looking at the in-game/Battle.net achievement list: Many of them rely on luck, some require only time, and few require actual skill.

There is a potentially good - no, great - game here but it is wrapped up in a myriad of poor design decisions such as questionable character balance, poor map design, poor netcoding, and the allowance of hero stacking (which exacerbates all three of the other issues). There are tons of complaints about individual characters but the issue really is a combination of all four problems always happening at once. Sure, the complaints about Bastion's sentry mode with no slow down on aiming, no spread on shots, and no ramp up before firing are valid but they're almost always a problem BECAUSE the maps are designed to heavily favor defending teams by either providing too few pathways for attackers, by allowing blatant base camping, or by putting an easy to defend choke point right outside of the defending team's spawn base (while the attacking team usually has to run a fair distance from their last checkpoint after death). Now add that the game allows multiples of the same character and one can see how the issues become multiplied.

There's also the fact that Blizzard themselves have confirmed that the game's servers only run at a 20 tick rate (less than a third of what's considered minimum standard) and also includes a baked in latency delay to ""favor the shooter"" (read: prevent the need for leading shots) *on top of* each player's normal latency. Cheap, unavoidable deaths (such as being killed as Mei while in Ice Block or as Tracer after Rewinding because the server simply didn't ""see"" it relative to your opponent's latency+built-in delay) are frustratingly frequent.

The matchmaking system is just... bad. I generally split my time between running in a small group of 3-4 people or running solo depending on time of day. Not that it matters, mind: Regardless of running solo or grouped, either you're going to steamroll the opposing team or you're going to get steamrolled. In 213 games played so far, I can say that two dozen (or less) of those were close matches where the teams were really fighting to win. As for the rest, we either won by a large margin or lost by a large margin and very few last longer than 7.5 minutes. This might seem fun at first but it quickly becomes mindnumbing. I'm not sure what they use to determine rating for matchmaking but it feels off and it certainly doesn't help that some maps are designed almost entirely to promote steamrolls by the defending team - maps like Temple of Anubis and Route 66, both of which my usual group now leave any time they pop up in the rotation. Not because we can't win on them (we can and have) but because they're simply NOT fun to play on EITHER side.

There are very few elements of skill in Overwatch, mostly found in the support cast of Mercy, Lucio, Symmetra, and Zenyatta. For everyone else, this is a game of luck: Lucky timing on the acquisition of ultimate abilities, lucky placement of the enemy team, lucky netcode timing/lucky connection, lucky map selection, and so on. I would love to say I have faith in Blizzard to deal with these imbalances but I simply do not considering many of them were known as far back as Closed Beta and still went live at launch (not to mention their 8.5 year long struggles balancing Warcraft's Arena PVP system with far fewer classes).… Expand"

Whut?

Yeah, this game has potential, it has promise, but it also has a lot of problems too. Character balance is awful, fans of the game will tell you that it's an amazing game where being able to change your character means it's a constant game of rock paper scissors. That is until you realise that half a dozen characters in the game are both rock and paper, or scissors and rock, or even all three, when played by someone with a modicum of experience.

Half objective based team shooter, half team deathmatch, the game shines when it is played like the former and results in pure frustration and anger because 2 or 3 people playing it like the latter can ruin any real sense of strategy or territorial control.

But then the game clearly isn't set up to be a game of tactical nuance. Spawn times are almost non-existent meaning defenders are constantly able to defend, and maps are so poorly designed that they're either too open or too narrow.

But ultimately (no pun intended?) what kills it for me are the one-two combos that many characters have that are nigh on impossible to counter without one of those rock and paper characters I previously mentioned. Roadhog's Chain and point blank shotgun blast will kill almost anyone in one shot after dragging them (with no counter and a stun) to right infront of him. McCree can stun you in place with a flashbang, unload his 6 shooter, roll for instant reload and shoot you for 6 against straight away. Mei only has to start hitting you with her stream of ice and, unless you have some kind of ""escape"" ability, you're going to be toast as she freezes you in place and then lines up a headshot while you can do nothing and kills you.

This game is touted as supposedly being about being a ""Postive"" FPS, where people aren't downvoted or reported, where people are encouraged to commend people for achievements, where everyone gets ""elimination"" stats for having taken part in a kill. But at it's core it's a devious deathmatch game which rewards trolling behaviour by one player against another.

But fans will tell you that there is depth and skill to this game, which may be true for Blizzard fans that have come from outside an FPS environment. For those of us that have been playing the genre for 20 years aren't seeing anything fundamentally new here, and what is new (the MOBA ability elements) are hamfistedly introduced without care for what makes MOBA games work... that good positioning and ancillary item use can counter and lessen the effects of people's abilities and ultimates, something entirely not present in this game.

Ever since Wrath of the Lich King, Blizzard has released increasingly low quality titles that somehow manage to get good reviews and make a lot of money. Overwatch is another Blizzard title that is more like a mobile app than an actual multi platform game.

Pros and cons:

+ Not many bugs or stability issues, runs really well
+ All characters are unlocked from the go so you can easily try your favorite hero
+ Lots of different characters with different play styles
+ Graphics are typical for Blizzard, game looks pretty nice and doesn't require you to have a beefy PC

- Netcode is quite simply horrible
- Servers seemingly don't boot players with extreme pings
- Game is designed around countering heroes/teams rather than improving your skills
- Many auto win mechanics that will net you easy cheap kills with a press of a button
- Matchmaking right now is quite bad, most rounds are insanely unfair and end pretty fast with one team just steamrolling the other. I've only had a handful of rounds that felt balanced and played well.
- Punishing for solo players
- Only a few maps and game modes, game is very repetitive. After playing for about 10-15 hours you've already seen and experienced the entire game and it doesn't really offer variety since the maps always play exactly the same.
- For 40€, you get a polished game worth about 10 hours of play time, most f2p titles can offer twice that, easily.
- The game is constantly trying to guess where you're character is going to move because the tickrate is so low, so you will notice (at least I do, playing with 144hz @ 144+ fps) a lot of stuttering when moving as a fast character. To me this is really really annoying and I can't understand why this would be a thing in 2016.

Conclusion:

This is one of those games that feels like the designers were focusing on perfecting one aspect of the game and completely forgot about everything else. In traditional Blizzard manner, this game is pretty much bug/glitch free and runs really really well, performance wise. It is however very apparent that Blizzard has no experience making FPS games. The horrible netcode, cheesy free kill mechanics and lack of content really scream for f2p. I do understand the benefits of having a 40€ price, as it will discourage cheating and will eliminate any sort of pay-to-win model, but trying to justify that price for a multiplayer only title that has as much content as Dirty Bomb seems hard.

Nevertheless, this will be a fun game to play with friends, for a while. I wouldn't pay full price for it unless they add more free content in the future. If you are an FPS games, this game is probably not for you, as it seems to be more aimed at the MOBA people out there. I've played a lot of games but I would consider myself mostly an FPS games, and I can safely say this game is definitely NOT aimed at players like myself.… Expand"

The best part is every character is weak against other certain characters. For instance, bastion is a death machine but if tracer gets behind him with her ultimate ability then bastion is screwed. You would think after a few matches the game would get boring, but every match is different.

The game is REALLY team based, meaning that no matter how good you are, you can't carry your team to victory. So forget getting any enjoyment from the game if you don't have at least 3 friends to play with.

The maps are poorly designed, with multiple chokepoints which result in long lasting stalemates (even up to 10-15 minutes because of the overtime counter).

The game is only fun when you play maybe one to two matches per day, and when you are winning.

-Heroes are pretty balanced against each other in a vacuum (HOWEVER, the game isn't a vacuum. See below)
-Beautiful game design, smooth operation
-Great and easy to use group feature

CONS:
-Horrible, horrible, horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE map design. Perhaps some of the worst maps ever made into a shooter game can be found in Hanamura, Temple of Anubis and Volskaya Industries. These maps are comically easy to defend, and require a level of total and complete team competence to attack that is all but unheard of in a pub setting.
-Similarly, cheese defense is way too easy and way too effective. Yes, heroes like Bastion and Torbjorn may be counterable in theory, but actually going out and breaking their line of defense on the game's atrocious maps is perhaps the hardest task I've ever come across in a video game
-Overtime is similarly a very poor design. Losers become winners and winners become losers because of it. Often times in the control point modes, a team will hit 99% but they will not win because of their defenses finally cracking during the game's ludicrously rewarding overtime.
-20 tick servers are awful, you will get hit around corners a lot
-Because of the issues above, the game is about as competitive as a game of catch
-low amounts of content but I'm not scoring on this because it's definitely going to change as the game evolves

Overall, I give overwatch's current state a 4/10. It isn't anything spectacular and is plagued by a number of nuisances that just aren't suitably beatable for pub play. That being said, it's a great amount of fun and it will definitely stick around for a while.… Expand"

In one word: Gorgeous. Truly there isn't anything negative I can say about this game's presentation. From textures to particle effects, from guns to snarky quips, this game is perfect in this category. Overwatch doesn't necessarily have the highest fidelity textures, but this game's unique style makes this game an absolute pleasure to look at. From the get go, this game bombards you with fantastic looking particle effects. Every explosion and ultimate is jaw-dropping and incredibly well done. The sound is amazing as well. I'm very particular when it comes to sound, but I think this is probably the best sounding game I've ever played. The soundtrack is great, the voice actors are great, and every gun sounds unique and well done.

Content

I guess the thing you should know going into this game is that it is multiplayer only. There is no single player campaign, and there is no co-op mode. There are also twelve maps and every map has its own particular gamemode. To me, that is a reasonable amount of maps, but for a game that only has multiplayer, I'd like to see more. I would wager to guess we will get some later down the line, most likely via a paid map pack, but maybe they will add some new free maps as this game progresses. Again though, this is a similar amount of maps that launch with other big FPS games like Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Battlefront. There are twenty-one different heroes that all have their own unique play style. I love the amount of variety in them, and with the loot box system, you can customize every aspect of them; like skins, intros, and voice lines, to your liking. Each hero has fifty-four different items to can get via the loot box system and you get a loot box for every level gained. You can also purchase them through the store. If this was a $60 game, I would worry about the amount of content, but the reduced price of $40 makes it worth it in my opinion.

Gameplay

This is where this game shines the most. Overwatch's unique blend of teamwork and gun gameplay gives it a fantastic feeling and very rewarding shooter. This game certainly will have the longevity everyone was hoping for and it seems like it will make a perfect game for the eSports scene. Like I mentioned earlier, each hero feels and plays differently, meaning you can vary how you play this game every match or every death if you feel so inclined. I don't think any particular hero is distinctly overpowered and every hero does have a couple of counters available. Obviously with every multiplayer shooter, your enjoyment is dependent at least in part on the other players in the game, but I find this game to be very enjoyable the vast majority of the time. I find it fun to be able to tailor my play-style based on the map, or the gamemode, or what my teammates are using to best help us win. With Overwatch, I can do that with the wide array of characters available. What truly keeps me coming back is finding your role within a team, and help leading them to victory.

Overall

This is the best shooter I've played in years. I think this game is a definite must-buy for any FPS fan. Now If you'll excuse me, I have to get back to playing Overwatch.… Expand"

88,rustyfeeder,"May 27, 2016",5,This game is mediocre. It lacks creativity and originality. There are many f2p games of the same genre out there. It has Blizzard brand behind it and an army of Blizzard fans. Remove this and I doubt this game would be any such popular. It is really sad to see that so many innovative games do not get attention and games like this receive so much praise.

It's merely a cherry on top that this comes with a colorful cast of characters/classes that are bursting at the seams with personality and individual design, along with being very well-balanced for a game on release, both in terms of it's classes and it's levels and modes. This is worth checking out for anyone. It's a video game that's invigorating and just does FUN right, which is something that a lot of games seem to overlook.

Overwatch is an awesome game. It does lack modes on launch, but when the modes it has are presented as strongly as they are, that's not necessarily a huge issue.… Expand"

93,ExoticaOblivion,"May 27, 2016",10,I think it is a great shooter from Blizzard. Its the best I can't stop playing it. I got it for ps4 and once i started my first round I was so excited that it came with all its characters and weapons. Honestly I just wanted to write a review to give it a 10 out of 10 because I love this game.

No hay innovación ni grandes características que cumplan con el hype y la publicidad que le da la prensa, en otras palabras no es más que un free to play."

But it's basically a hero based arena shooter where each hero has something that makes it unique from the rest, This causes some heroes to be stronger against others or vice versa. Your success in Overwatch is directly related to your teams lineup and how well you work together. Playing solo may result in some very bad games if your team isn't wanting to work together. Playing with groups of friends will be much more enjoyable. Currently Overwatch only has Quick Matches and personal ranks but they plan to add a full ranked mode for people who want to take it seriously.
The design behind Overwatch is done so perfectly, Everything from sound to characters it all just works so well together. Audio queues will let you know if someone is using a Ultimate or even the foots steps of a specific hero. Not much bad can be said when it comes to this aspect of Overwatch.
One of the only things you can complain about with Overwatch is Matchmaking and team builds. Nothing is more discouraging then getting destroyed by a full grouped team over and over or getting paired up against people much higher level players. This will hopefully be fixed with the addition of competitive mode. Also having team stack one hero can make a game unplayable...some of the builds you can make up are nothing but torture.
All in all if you enjoy multiplayer games like Team Fortress 2 and you are able to keep your cool give Overwatch a try.… Expand"

I really really wanted to give this game a chance.   I have been a Blizzard fan since Warcraft 1 on PC...owning and playing every game they have released religiously.

Overwatch has good character design, smooth game play, decent graphics on PC/PS4 but no innovative features or game modes that will pull me away from any of my top FPS/TPS games (old and new).   Overwatch is a simplified FPS compared to others and it's not necessarily a bad thing.  The maps are well designed for close quarter battles and the game doesn't drag long.
I think the simplicity of it will draw new players to the genre so they can pick it up easily.   To me,  it seems like they made this game for beginners to the FPS genre.  Sure vets can still play it and have fun with the characters abilities but if you look at it overall it's not as FUN as it can and should be.

It reminds me of the same thing they tried to do when they entered the MOBA genre with Heroes of the Storm.  They simplified it compared to other MOBA games but I got bored of it quickly.  Maybe I'm an old hardcore gamer and I want to get my money's worth.  But $60 is alot of money for a multiplayer only FPS game with only 2 modes  There's not even a campaign with all the story behind the characters.
Star Wars Battlefront basically multiplayer only but Battlefront is a much better FPS.  Like AMAZING compared to boring Overwatch!  Plus, the 2 game modes of hold the area and move the convoy aren't really exciting at all to play.  Couldn't they think of something more creative?   Heck! The game modes in Unreal Tournament especially 2004 still blow the Overwatch away.  Unreal 2004 (and on) still has the most enjoyable and creative progression objectives like Assault, Onslaught, etc.    Instead of a boring hold this spot then protect this new spot or convey.  It would've helped Overwatch tremendously if they learned from the game modes of Call of Duty, Castle Wolfenstein, Unreal Tournament and not just copying mainly Team Fortress.   I would've gladly pay $60 for this multiplayer-exclusive FPS game if it had better modes and features.  For example, maybe with some maps or modes they could have a train fight scenario to find the bomb, destroy big turret by progressively completing objectives.   So Overwatch is just a plain shooter.  Nothing special at all.  You could play any sci-fi shooter of the past and still get the same experience but just without the awesome character design.

Overwatch took some good ideas from some FPS but not enough to make it great.
It's just a ""clone"" FPS with a gorgeous reskin of characters with special moves.
I'm a big fan of Blizzard and have played all their games religiously and even own collector's edition of all the PC games (from Warcraft, Diablo, Starcraft and I even bought the Overwatch one).  But I'm sorry I have to give this one a bad rating.  Not sure who took over creative directing at Blizzard but this one is a fail to me.  It might do well for teeny-boppers and millenials that jump on the hype.  And most likely Blizzard will front a bunch of $million dollar tournaments because they can.  But that still doesn't help make this a great FPS.  It's below average to me.  Even Team Fortress and Counterstrike are more fun than this.   They may only have a few maps or modes but they were the originators and still the BEST.  Blizzard tried to copy them and some other FPS but ended up being flat in the end.… Expand"
