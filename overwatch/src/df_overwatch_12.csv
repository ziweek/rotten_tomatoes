So the good about Overwatch, it's a nice escape from the usual FPS games you normally play (call of duty, battlefield etc). Overwatch is a nice change and is a truly enjoyable experience also if you bored of the same kind of gameplay just switch to a different character because each character plays differently and is just as fun as the next (use Roadhog... best ever).

9,Syyntric,"May 25, 2016",9,"9/10 in a heartbeat, and here's why:
I've read the reviews from people about why this game is bad, and I do understand why, but I can't help but disagree. People have said now that it's repetitive, lacks a story-line, and isn't worth anything more than $10, and the big one, ""The blizzard name is the only reason people are buying it.""

People have said now that it's repetitive, lacks a story-line, and isn't worth anything more than $10, and the big one, ""The blizzard name is the only reason people are buying it.""
I strongly disagree. I have found a lot of variability in this game, through the different maps and different characters. Your gameplay is constantly changing, as you have to pick different characters in order to hold off an enemy team's push if your original team composition wasn't working out. This game, although it doesn't feel like it, requires at least a little bit of thinking, such as ""When is a good time to use this ultimate?"" Or, ""What can I do or who can I pick to really support my team more?""
Now, to story-line. It is understandable that, as this is a Blizzard game, it is almost expected for them to have a campaign of some sort, and any type of backstory, and it really does. Each character has its own unique backstory into the whole story of Overwatch, before the setting of the game. The backstories make for great reads. Also, Blizzard is working on very detailed animated shorts that explain each characters' backstories were, in a more engaging way.

This is easily one of them most engaging FPS' I have ever played on PC, in it's own unique way. I'm not saying this is any Battlefield game, or more similarly, Quake arcade-like shooter, but it's still so engaging to it's audience. The 98 rating, as of right now as I write this, is extremely justified. I have played north of maybe 15-16 hours of this game somewhat, and I have enjoyed every minute of it.

The only reason why I haven't given this game a 10/10 is because you will not enjoy it as much if you aren't playing with at least one other friend.… Expand"

- While not crazy advanced, the graphics are super cool. A nice art style that perfectly merges cartoon and futuristic themes.
- The game is running pretty well and with almost no performance issues at launch. That's pretty impressive considering how the market have been treating launches lately.

Cons
- The price is way too high. It's the most expensive game ever released in my country. Something close to 90 USD. Considering the amount of content, this game should be F2P. So that's a terrible move by Blizzard. If it wasn't for the price, I'd easily give this game a 9.
- Some unbalanced combat situations. Some might argue that I just didn't learn how to effectively counter some specific characters yet. Indeed, I'm still learning so I can't tell for sure, but at first, some classes feel way stronger then others.
- 20 Hz tick rate? Choose Tracer and don't stop moving. You're pretty much invincible. Those hit boxes, man.
- Being so casual has it's price. The game just released but the lack of more complex game modes and rankings will probably make me grow tired of this pretty soon. There's nothing that forces me to come back and pick up from where I left off. No career progression, nothing.

But what it desperately really needs is more content. That, or a reasonable price tag for the content it offers now. It feels like Battlefront all over again. Except it plays a lot better.… Expand"

There is a terribly vague story-line(prologue) that has been given to the audience through webisodes, speculation and theories over the forums at the cost of not having anything in-game regarding a story. ( I do not count 'decyphering' (3) dialogue lines of Heroes associating themselves with specific heroes in a match.)

There is a very poorly optimized progression system that doesn't feel rewarding at all. Every level you obtain a lootbox which contains cosmetic goodies and/or currency whilst every 10 levels you get a new portrait frame. That's literally all there is to the progression system.

(I bet the reason they wiped this false progression after the beta; people that spent their entire time to reach high level such as rank 200, was simply to push those people to buy microtransactions immediately. Since it held no advantage over other players anyway, so it wouldn't have made any sense.)

There are only two gamemodes, capturing points and securing the payload/explosives. You are unable to pick a specific gamemode yourself.

There are 6 maps, the rounds are terribly short and you are also unable to pick a specific map to play on.

The social aspect is severely uncreative, only pre-made lines as there isn't a 'partying up' feature within the game.

Customization is uncreative as well, all of the skins are just recolours except the legendary ones.

There is no reward system that seems to drive you to play or achieve something.

For me, the game feel unfinished. Like it's a late stage beta or something. There just isn't enough content to keep players hooked for a considerable period of time.

The gameOverwatch is a Objective/Hero based FPS game created by Blizzard Entertainment that takes an approach to the heavily saturated genre of FPS in a similar fashion to team fortress. The look, feel, and game-play elements of the game however are nothing like that of the popular F2P titles of TF2 other than its core aspect and a couple of game modes that have been cleverly renamed.

The game modes may have the same objectives as other FPS but unlike other FPS each map is designed around a specific game mode and does not have to share other game modes into its boundaries. This allows for each map to have elements and spawns that are designed around that specific game mode in mind.

Each map evolves as you play through the match as the offensive team pushes through to their ultimate goal. Cleverly placed choke holds allow for strong defensive counter play, but hiding spots, and holes in the map allow for sneaky Hero's to pry the defenses away from the choke point but getting behind the enemies front lines. Each character has several abilities that give them flavors and counter plays to specific encounters, and a game breaking ultimate ability that must be charged through damaging enemy players, or waiting long enough, allows for hefty changes in the dominating forces. Each game provides a chance for the loosing team to somehow pry themselves a win last min with an overtime clock, giving the game a close win/loose feeling at the end of every game.

Aesthetically this game is a world of its own with how well the art styles is done and how well the music and textures tie into the game play. Characters feel alive as they each have a personality that is reflected with every bullet they shoot, or ability they activate.

You destroy enemies extremely quickly and the hit boxes are ridiculously big. I consider my decent at shooting games (not amazing) but I also couldn't miss a headshot. I also have good latency so I won the click first battle more the times.

I tried most of the characters. I loved playing Genji, Tracer & Bastion.
The problem is that there is not enough content to justify its price tag. There may be 21 characters but none of them can be further modified (save cosmetically). There are lots of maps but most are repetitive.
Another problem is with the PS4 controls. I may have not gotten the sensitivity settings right (used default, then tweaked every 4 games) but I found it more difficult to to track enemies with the cursor compared to COD, Destiny, Borderlands.

Blizzard is the master of making characters equal that are completely different.  This is the same, like they've done masterfully with starcraft they have made each individual character unique yet somehow able to defeat any other character given the time and situation.  That quality limits the total number of players, but 6v6 is a good start.  The game is complete bang for your buck at 39.99.  Console versions are 59.99 at the request of fans.  Blizzard didn't have to do this and release it for consoles as they are mainly a PC focused company, but they purchased the resources and charge 20 dollars more on consoles.  If you don't like it, don't buy it, but I think it's a reasonable request and it makes fans happy that they were willing to fold and get the game onto our televisions with a controller.
Gameplay took me a couple of days.  At first I admit I was minorly dissapointed.  I then started going through the reccomended tutorials and learned how to use a couple of characters.  I started to notice subtle advantages like the last bullet doing more damage than the others.  Slowly I found out that characters had great advantages if played a certain way and focus on timings.  My friend logged in and we played on a team as Mercy and Sabastian.  The fun factor exploded and we had many joyous moments as we almost died but didn't and barely overtook the team in several matches.  It was really fun and seems like a game most would want to consider keeping in their library.… Expand"

I have other a thousand hours in Splatoon compared to my handful in OverWatch, and I honestly would much rather return to Splatoon for another thousand before popping this game in ever again.

That's the difference in quality we are talking about here. I am not trying to hype up Splatoon, here. I am here merely to offer my experiences with Overwatch and how I find, in my opinion, that it is a waste of time. There are so many better games out there... why bother with this one? Because it's brand new? Please. By that logic, Uncharted 4 would be the best game ever made, even though the recent Tomb Raider reboot was a superior experience in every way.

So what about Overwatch makes me so upset?

There are too many examples to list, really, so I think I will just sum up: It's just not fun. That's it. That's all I have to say about this title in particular because that's all I need to say. The game is just not fun.

There is not enough time in your life to waste talking about or playing bad games. It's time for us to move on, forget about Overwatch, and play some more Splatoon. Who is with me?… Expand"

I don't play Blizzard's other games, they just aren't for me. But for what they are, they are quality.

This game IS like Team Fortress 2, but new and fresh. If you liked TF2, you'll like this. It's like Payload and Capture point.

This game is fun, polished, and quite simply breathtaking. So many twists and turns can happen in a match your jaw will drop. You think you are winning, nope, someone tactically uses one of their abilities, and bam... the momentum flips. Then it flips again, then again. This IS Overwatch.

Amazing game, easy to get into, and fun. Get hooked and you'll be coming back for more... and more... and more.

This game fills a great gap that has been overlooked by other FPS games (which I love too). Again, this game is ultra polished. With 21 characters, you'd think it might not mesh. Wrong. This game meshes, and so many characters are made so teammates can piggyback off your abilities to create one helluva dynamic game. Also with so many characters you can easily switch to one to tactically neuter someone on the other team and even things up. 12 maps have all sorts of crazy pathways.  They are not small maps, is a TF2 payload map small?  I don't think so.

Oh you play Winston, jumping all around going APE taking out the other teams support healing character like Mercy, well you can place down that shield and your teammates have a few seconds to stand in it laying waste to those outside it. Or you can have a Reinhardt with his shield up and you stand behind it laying waste and slowly advancing to the control point or shielding you to some nook and cranny pathway to get behind the enemy. Tracer can warp in front of Reinhardt throw her bomb and use the playback (or whatever) ability and warp back behind the shield.  Teamwork definitely works in this game.

You have Junkrat who is like Team Fortress 2's Demoman. Except he also has a super ability which is like a big explosive wheel that you can drive into your enemies. But of course they can shoot it a few times and destroy it.  I've taken out an entire team multiple times before with that explosive wheel.  Talk about a momentum flip.

You have Torbjorn which is like TF2's Engineer, except instead of building a dispenser and trying to constantly upgrade it as you build a turret, you can upgrade the turret easily without any spare metal and let it be while you are using your molten lead gun. Then you can use your super ability which upgrades you and the turret to level 3 laying waste for about 20 seconds.

You even got D.VA which looks like a Japanese Mecha whose super bunny nuke explosion super ability is great. If the mecha gets damaged, you can eject (or when charged up that nuke a real momentum flip) and then you can run around still alive and if you get a few hits, you can Titanfall another Mech really fast.

Mercy can heal and is a great asset.  She can also raise an entire team from the dead.

This game has so many play styles via it's characters it's insane. I can understand people trying one or two characters and saying it's not for them because they didn't know what they were doing and lost, but these people really didn't give the game a chance. Right now I feel like I got 5 or 6 characters down and each one is different and fun. So many other characters to master along the way.

People that complain about leveling up, getting loot packs (which is the only thing you get from leveling up), and getting COSMETIC items that have NO BEARING on play and that some people can buy them are morons. This does not mean F2P, only morons think so.

So check the low scores. They are from morons who don't know what the hell they are talking about. They think this is F2P,  say it's Full Priced, and bag about online only games. Or they barely played the beta. They overlook the FACT that this game will be getting FREE modes, FREE characters, and FREE maps.

All for $39.99

This game is going to be around for a long time, and the content will only grow. Get in now, enjoy the game, and enjoy the content drops as they come. It's a 10 because it does exactly what you hope such a game would be. It does it well, very polished, and free stuff will keep it fresh for years to come. Most importantly, it's fun.

Some people just can't accept games that are online focused.  They don't care if free maps and characters are coming.  They hate on RB6: Siege.  They hate on SW:BF because it was made in less time then your average CoD but COMPLETELY new.  They hate because there's no SP.  They forget to look at what the game IS!

Another positive aspect is the smooth release, the game and servers worked, normaly this should be the norm but it sadly isnt.

Many of the worse reviews mention the lack of content, there are only 21 heroes and 12 maps and the price is 40$. But as far as i know Blizzard said there will be contentupdates which will be free. If youre not supe hyped you probably should just maybe wait a bit and see how the game expands.

You also should reconsider tho buy this game if you plan to solo-que, teamplay is really important in Ow so you probably will get steamrolled a lot by premate-teams. I didnt play that much solo, but i can say it happens like every 10 matches.
(easy solution: just search for people on ts-servers or somewhere else.)

Overall i think Overwatch is a well polished game with a fresh idea and even with good lore, plus the lack of content will be solved over time.

- Switching characters allows actions and reactions to every team composition, sounds weird at first, but you'll never go back after experiencing it.
- Blizzard adding all future gameplay content (ie: everything but skins) for free. Plans for maps, modes, and heroes coming in the future.

Cons:
- MP only can still be daunting for some, although I contest that it is fun even for players new to FPS

Yes! The game is fun but it's not 10/10 fun, it is going to get stale after several long hour playthroughs you are going to see the same things over and over again.

It's difficult to ever feel good at playing this game since you're not given the opportunity to select the character you enjoy or want to learn.  Rather, you'll need to pick the tank or healer role most of the time. The alternative is that everyone is a sniper or Reaper and you'll lose the game within 30-45 seconds (this has happened to me more than once). Unless you're a huge Blizzard fanboy, more power to you if you are, this game gets old extremely fast. The $60 price tag for consoles is ludicrous, and Blizzard has the audacity to bring in microtransactions on top of that price. Every one of my friends I've played with has gone right back to whatever game they were playing after about 2 hours of Overwatch.

P.S. A game being ""polished"" is not a feature, it just means the game is actually working as intended.

Game features 21 heroes with lots of unlockables. Each hero has an interesting passive and a set of cool abilities but many of heroes are either over-powered ATM or either or with such a low skill cap they do an insane amount of damage which results in ez 1v3 in games. I feel like the game is not in a playbale estate and needs lots of re balancing in terms of abilities ratios.
Secondly the game doesnt have much content. aside from tones of unlockables, maps and heroes will be summarized in about 1 hour. The rest of your time will be spent on playing the similar modes again and again. Although i should say the maps and their layers are awesome! may be one of the best map designs ever.
But the actual concern for me comes in when you can switch heroes in the game. When such a features exist then what is the definition of mastering a certain hero or a roll. as far as I have played either no1 wants to support or we see 2 bastion in single game. I feel like in terms of choosing heroes the game should locks it for 1 choice and one champ per a game, this way the team will be enforced to a better team building and teamwork.
Lastly, the game doesnt have much content, but I hope blizzard updates it with free new modes and maps and perhaps new heroes and features. After seeing what it has to offer the rest of your time will be spent on understanding maps, item locations and mastering a hero regarding their abilities in respect to the team and map itself. But I fink this will not be possible for every1 since the game allows you to switch freely between characters. Like i said this decision questions if mastering a hero or a certain roles matters at all. Perhaps only for team games, other than that the quick game mode of Overwatch is a chaotic and frustrating set of short gameplay which teaches you nothing and rewards you wit nothing as well. Other than this I will not recommend This game if you fink this will satisfy your love for MOBA games as a FPS shooter. Its a game with a very low skill cap IMO.

However to simply call the game a first person shooter would be a disservice. Blizzard has crafted a game in this emergent genre of 'hero shooters/arena shooters; that borrows the best ideas from other games in the genre like Team Fortress 2. Blizzard has put their own spin on it to make it a fresh experience. The art style is fantastic too and is primed for a feature length film. It really is some gorgeous stuff and I don't think its an stretch to say that the visuals themselves would look at home in a Pixar film.

The performance is rock solid as well. The game has been incredibly well optimized and features one of the most robust suites of options I have seen in a PC game. This feels like it was built from the ground up for PC. You can customize damned near any key. You also can adjust key-bindings at the hero level. Yup, you have a set of key-bindings for each of the 21 heroes currently in the game. You can also customize the shape, and color of the on screen reticle. Its this attention to detail that shows in just about every area of the game.

Overwatch centers its focus on its heroes and how their abilities can be used with and against other heroes. Its focus on team composition and allowing you to swap heroes gives the game incredible depth and an underlying layer of player choice and strategy.

The game features a variety of modes such as training, practices vs. AI, as well as quick play. Within these modes the actual game types themselves can consist of things like payload (familiar to fans of TF2), capture point and King of the hill style matches. One of the criticisms leveled against the game is lack of content. I would agree with this statement if it was in regards to the number of modes themselves. But not every game needs a single player campaign. I feel that with the number of heroes on display here, a single player campaign would have diluted the multiplayer experience. Jeff Kaplan of Blizzard also pointed out that support heroes like Mercy would be tough to work into a single player campaign because of their nature as support heroes.

I would like to see more modes added over time. Perhaps Capture the flag. I don't think Team Death-match would fit well either. Blizzard has smartly decided to de-emphasize kills and kdr in favor of promoting team play. What is odd however is that the majority of the 'play of the game' are from people/heroes who rack up a lot of kills.

The game features a commendation system which on its own doesn't really mean much. But it can be nice to get commendations from your team mates if you do a good job of healing. It also has things like ""damage blocked."" It is a way of saying hey look how well you did your job, or performed your role.

The game features a progression system that gives you a loot box when you level up. These drops can be anything ranging from currency to skins, avatars, sprays, voice lines or victory poses. Its all superfluous but it is a nice way of customizing your character and making it your own. The game does have micro-transactions but these are only for loot boxes which are at the end of the day cosmetic stuff and don't impact the game itself. My initial concern is that the more games you play the higher the chance you will get duplicates from loot boxes. Fortunately those duplicates  do reward you gold which can then be used towards something else you don't have.

In the end Overwatch is a fantastic well crafted game despite needing a few more modes. Blizzard have created a solid platform to build upon and have stated that future heroes and maps will be free which is very welcome indeed. Multiplayer only games can struggle to find success. Overwatch however has enough depth in its gameplay that it never felt repetitive.… Expand"

Unfortunately there simply isn't as much depth to this game as there is in TF2 with only 12 maps and 2 game modes (yes, I know there is technically a 3rd mode, but it is just a mashup of the 2 game modes).

Despite the varied cast of playable characters, the game gets repetitive quickly.  Especially since a lack of balance means you'll be seeing the same heroes over and over, sometimes 2-3 at once, each and every game.  Yes, hero stacking is a thing.  Additionally, there isn't enough of a payoff for mastering higher skillcap heroes when playing a lower skillcap hero can be more effective (looking at you Bastion).

Another issue I had is the lack of a story.  Blizzard put a lot of time and effort into the animated shorts it released in order to set up the story for Overwatch.  Yet, in the game there is not hint at any story, largely because there is no single player campaign, which this game is just begging for.  It's a puzzling decision, and makes it all the more awkward when your team consists of characters heroes and characters that are villains.  Why are they fighting together?  No idea.  To me, this represents a lost opportunity for a game that truly could have been special.

Then there is the elephant in the room, the price.  At $60, the content provided feels more like a free to play game than full on AAA release like Call of Duty, where at $60 you get a single player campaign, a lot more multiplayer modes, and a compelling unlock/leveling system.  Oh, and did I mention Overwatch even has microtransactions?  The content and value simply isn't there to justify the price of Overwatch.  I have no doubt the game will sell millions by virtue of the fact it is a Blizzard product, but it's sad that the company that gave us the Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo franchises isn't even giving players a fraction of the content that a $60 price tag should include.
