The problem is player population. As the months have gone by, the shrinking pool of players in my country has caused the matchmaking to become worse and worse. It is now common to spend 3-4 minutes waiting for a match, even during peak times in the evening on weekends. These long waits are more often than not followed by an unbalanced match. I have no problem losing games, what I have a problem with is getting steamrolled by the same team 4-5 games in a row, then steamrolling another team, or getting backfilled into a losing game with no chance of winning. I understand that online matchmaking is not a perfect science, and the algorithm is probably doing the best that it can to provide good matches, but there simply are not enough players to make it happen. The $70AUD price tag for a multiplayer only game almost a year after it's release is almost certainly the cause of this problem. This game deserves a 9 for it's gameplay, honestly, however Blizzard's desire to gouge Australian gamers is killing this game, at least for me.… Expand"
2,Tenebris,"Sep 20, 2017",4,"A game that looks good from the outside, but the more you play it, the more its many flaws stand out.

-Poor balance. The game is probably in the worst state it's ever been. Between new problems like Doomfist's instant kill, overbuffing Mercy and DVa, and longstanding problems like Pharmercy, Hanzo's scatter and certain characters just being perpetually OP (76) or UP (Sombra) with few or no changes, it seems like Blizzard doesn't have a clue what to do. Though given their history with Starcraft and WoW, I guess this should not come as a surprise.

-Terrible matchmaker. It's been over a year and I'm still pretty sure this thing just enforces 50% win rate. Also in non-comp modes be prepared to get matched with players hundreds, often thousands of levels about you, because evidently there's not enough new players.

- Waiting for game: be prepared to wait typically 2-6 times longer than the estimated time even during peak play times. Maybe there's just not that many people playing the game? I usually see the same 10 people over and over too, even after leaving at match's end.

- Maps: You can't choose which map you want to play on, and even if you could, the majority of them are just slight variations on TF2's Dustbowl, with or without a payload.

- Character variety: Have fun getting reported for playing an off-meta hero in Quickplay. Mystery Heroes sounds fun, but since there's no limits it generally comes down to whichever team gets 3 D.Va's or something FotM. Deathmatch seemed like a breath of fresh air, but you probably won't stand a chance unless you're using one of a handful of characters with low-skill instant kill moves (Doomfist's right click, Hanzo's Scattershot, McCree's flashbang).

- Dumbs down a lot of typical FPS things for casuals: No fall damage, infinite ammo, very little self-damage, visible enemy health. Most heroes are very easy to use with low skill ceiling.

- Press Q to Win: You can play like garbage on attack the entire game, but plenty of ults can easily kill most of the enemy team or simply force them off the point, making for an easy win.

Add that all up with the repetitive feel of the game (In under a dozen hours, you will probably see just about everything the game has to offer), and I think giving it a 4/10 is still a little generous. Blizzard is slow to add content, and mostly we just get events with limited-time game modes and skins.… Expand"

It's filled with interesting mechanics, a nice art style, and fun gameplay. Sadly as a competitive shooter the game falls flat.

The gamemodes are almost a copy of TF2 involving either moving a payload or attack/defense control points. The way play these modes is through quick play, the weekly brawl, vs bots, or competitive(I will get to later). The game as of July 24th has 22 characters with there own ability's. Most of them are fairly generic like a sniper(widowmaker), a engineer(torbjorn), a scout(tracer), a soldier(Pharah), a medic(Mercy), and a demoman(junkrat), but the still differ themselves enough from there TF2 counterparts. The other characters though very one dimensional are fairly unique and offer a wide variety of gameplay styles. Each character typically only has 1 gun, 1-2 abilities, and a special. The guns control fairly well except they lack any recoil and really have a low skill ceiling to use most of them. Most of the abilities are cool like creating a ice wall or providing armor to teammates. The problem stems from the specials. Some of the specials are nothing much but the others are downright ridiculous. Here is where competitive falters, the specials not only are OP and unbalanced but take little to no skill to pull off.  Wallhacks, aimbots, Invincibility all sound like hacks but are REAL specials for some of the overwatch characters. That's not competitive nor fun to play with or against. To add to that there are broken hitboxes for most character and weapons making any chance to be competitive pushed to the side. Also you have to be level 25 to unlock competitive which takes far too long to achieve. The game even in casual is ruined by these ""Specials"" due to there limited skill to use and overall cheapness when you get killed by one. The soundtrack of this game however is great and fits the heroic mood of the game very well. I always enjoy booting up the game and hearing the music as I prepare for battle against...overwatch? Yea, the lore is fairly week as well as the gameplay doesn't correlate at all with the lore made for the game making you wonder what the point of having all those cool short films to advertise the game. Luckily that does little to affect the game play. The  last thing is the in game cosmetics which do look cool and don't affect the gameplay and it is fun to be rewarded with when you play more. The loot boxes are overpriced if you want to buy them but there really is no point. In conclusion Overwatch does have some great things going for it but as a competitive shooter it falls flat. Hopefully it goes for a more casual approach like TF2 did or a competitive approach instead of this frustrating middle ground of a unbalanced annoying mess. There is still going to be more updates so I'm eager to see what Blizzard does with the game in the future. 7.4/10 -Infinite… Expand"

Updated: A lot of the negative reviews are heavily outdated and most of the complaints here are no longer valid, including such claims as there only being two gamemodes (there's a lot more than that in the arcade section alone), hackers (I have not once played a game with a hacker), and other issues that are no longer prevalent. It's a shame to see a metascore be so unfairly affected by outdated issues and people who have no idea what they are truly talking about.

14,Rem,"Aug 31, 2017",10,"It's been 5 hours straight and not once did my eyes leave the screen, constantly glued to the mayhem as my team pulled a victory after forcing overtime. Overwatch lacks ""traditional"" features that would normally create all time great games. You won't find a compelling narrative or dozens of quests but what is here easily solidifies Overwatch's mark on gaming w/its perfected mechanics andIt's been 5 hours straight and not once did my eyes leave the screen, constantly glued to the mayhem as my team pulled a victory after forcing overtime. Overwatch lacks ""traditional"" features that would normally create all time great games. You won't find a compelling narrative or dozens of quests but what is here easily solidifies Overwatch's mark on gaming w/its perfected mechanics and style that have become synonymous w/Blizzard's name.

Overwatch’s strength lies in its simplicity and polish. Much like Team Fortress 2 or League of Legends, two teams of heroes battle on a handful of maps, and modes all boil down to some form of escorting, capturing, or protecting an objective. Other modes are available, but the game is at its best  keeping things close to the core, with maps everyone knows and easy-to-understand modes. While expectations today may call for a single-player campaign or a wide variety of modes, Overwatch’s consistently chaotic gameplay stands on its own, giving players the tools to ensure that no game ever plays out the same. These elements form the canvas where players paint unique experiences, match after match.

One thing to celebrate about Overwatch is its imaginative cast of heroes, all of which are diverse and amazingly designed. They might not have pages of lore, but they all are insanely creative w/abilities that make sense to their character. Time-traveling Tracer spews quirky British quips as she blinks across the battlefield, while tanky Winston roars and pummels enemies as he leaps about. All of them have interesting personalities, and you'll favorite a good amount just by playing the game, a rare achievement for a multiplayer-only game. These heroes have unique skillsets that ensure no heroes play the same; you’re not just embracing the sniper rifle or the rocket launcher, but ability kits that come together to form each of the 24 heroes. This establishes that each character isn't relegated to a single role, but rather one that adapts to rapidly changing conditions, all without the need for a clunky progression system. Maps are also well designed and balanced, keeping the flow of action constant. This is all supported by controls that are quick and easy to get a hang of, and it speaks volumes to Blizzard's craft that all heroes feel perfect to play, not once did I get frustrated b/c of how a hero controlled. Whether it was playing point defense as Bastion or denying area control from the enemy as Junkrat, neither felt clunky to handle. Team play is the focus, and Overwatch encourages players to swap characters constantly to deal with the ever-evolving nature of a match. You and your friends can assemble a traditional or any combination of tank/support/damage group to push the payload to victory. Rallying together for a last second push to win the game after a brutal team wipe provides an enjoyment level equal if not more to the most engaging of videogame narratives. Actual progression is tied to the unlockable skins, emotes, sprays, and voice lines all earned by loot boxes at each subsequent level up. It's a fair system and the fact that Blizzard is onboard to support the game w/free updates and events in the years to come ensures that Overwatch is going to stay installed for the foreseeable future.

Overwatch's visuals are lovely w/its colorful art style and simplicity. While there isn't buckets of gore or a menagerie of special effects, it's distinct and fitting to the universe Blizzard created. This approach also feeds into gameplay. Without an unnecessary amount of visual noise, it's easy to interpret what is going on even in the mayhem. The UI and menus are quick and clean to navigate, a rather underappreciated feature nowadays. The presentation is backed up by a spirited score which enhances the action, I felt like a kid watching his favorite heroes listening to the Victory theme, a feeling of both wonder and kickass unseen in many games. Audio cues by characters are also utilized to inform players of the shifting battlefield and whether or not an ally or enemy is unleashing their ultimate, which coupled w/excellent voice acting, further highlights the personalities of these heroes.

For many gamers, it's easy to dismiss Overwatch as another multiplayer title lacking in features. While I do wished for a campaign that tapped into the potential of the story hinted, I'd ultimately rather have a game solely crafted from strong components than have a weak link dragging the game down. What Overwatch lacks in evolution, it exceeds in perfection of game enjoyment. Its profound ability to provide drastically different experiences with each hero ensures that fresh explorations and hours of renewed enjoyment are a single click away. Like watching your favorite heroes, Overwatch feels inspired and instills a genuine sense of fascination all w/o the need for a cutscene. It's polished panache and scores of fun will leave a legacy known for endless nights of entertainment.… Expand"

Next is the social element, to be honest most players that I am on the same team with tends to be less competent then the computer at the easiest setting.  Additionally I tend to report at least one player every time I play, players refuse to actually realise what the game is about i.e. teamplay instead follow their own agenda and let the teammates die horribly.  Also those players who cannot play at all and blame other people on their team.
To be honest the game has potential like TF2 in the early days before it became free to play and became as appealing as a crack whore with crabs.
The main difference between this and TF2 is that TF2 has more variety, but unfortunately this game just cannot manage the competitive element.  As well as the classes being completely unbalanced and team members not wanting to participate as a team.

Stability: 7/10: The servers don't crash very often, but it takes a long time to download updates right after they are released, as the servers are overwhelmed. Multiple times I have had to wait in a queue to join the main servers, which is completely unacceptable in a game that was nearly one year old (At the time), especially if the game costs 40$. There has only been one major bug that required disabling a character for a short amount of time, but otherwise the game it's self has been fairly stable.

38,TitaniumDragon,"Jun 30, 2017",9,"Overwatch is a team-based objective-based first-person shooter which relies heavily on highly differentiated characters for its diverse and dynamic gameplay. The game includes 24 characters, each of which has a distinctive gameplay style and unique weapons and abilities. These characters are what make the game special.

There are four broad classes of characters, though in practice, twoOverwatch is a team-based objective-based first-person shooter which relies heavily on highly differentiated characters for its diverse and dynamic gameplay. The game includes 24 characters, each of which has a distinctive gameplay style and unique weapons and abilities. These characters are what make the game special.

There are four broad classes of characters, though in practice, two of them are often treated interchangeably. There are “Offense” heroes, characters who are focused on high mobility and dealing out lots of damage quickly, and “defense” heroes, who are more focused on zone control and dealing damage at range. There are support heroes, who are healers (plus one character who feels more like a defense character and is treated as such by the player base), and tank heroes – big, tough heroes who can take a lot more damage than their comrades and who can protect other heroes in various ways.

Within each of these, there is a lot of character variety. Offense heroes include heroes such as Tracer, a fast character who teleports around the battlefield and who can use a “recall” ability to rewind to her previous position and hit point status, whose gameplay centers around teleporting around enemies at close range and unloading her close-ranged weapons into them; Pharah, a character with a jetpack and a rocket launcher who can fly and shoot rockets at people; and Soldier 76, a fairly “normal” hero with a long-ranged assault rifle, the ability to sprint, and the ability to throw down a healing station on the ground and heal all nearby allies.

Defense heroes include sniper characters like Widowmaker, who uses a Batman-like rappel hook to get into high spots and whose weapon can transform between an assault rifle and a sniper rifle; Bastion, who can transform between a walk-around mode that fights sort of like a standard FPS hero, and a sentry form, where it turns into a gatling gun and rapidly mows down its adversaries; and Mei, a character who can create temporary ice walls, freeze enemies with her ice gun (slowing, then stunning them), and shoot icicles from range.

The support heroes range from Mercy, a character similar to the Medic from TF2 who heals a single nearby ally by pointing her stick in their general direction and holding it down to produce a healing beam, and who can fly around to allies in need of help, to characters like Zenyatta, a floating robotic monk who throws metal balls at his enemies while selecting individual allies to passively heal or enemies to passively debuff by causing them to take additional damage. Others include Lucio, a character who can ride off of walls and passively heal his allies by standing next to them, and Ana, a sniper who heals her allies by shooting them with her gun and who has a powerful tranquilizer dart which can temporarily put enemies to sleep until they take damage or as much as 8 seconds elapse.

The tank heroes include Reinhardt, a huge man in heavy metal armor with an enormous hammer, no ordinary ranged attack (though he does have an ability to launch a fireball every once in a while), and a huge shield that his allies can stand behind; Winston, a genetically-engineered gorilla who rapidly jumps around the battlefield zapping people with an area of effect gun and dropping large spherical barriers to hide under; and Roadhog, a gigantic man with a hook who punishes enemies for approaching too close in the open or attacking his allies by dealing heavy damage to those nearby.

These heroes work together as a hopefully coherent whole to try and complete map objectives. The game is heavily reliant on teamwork, and all of the heroes have their jobs to do. While everyone can deal damage, the specialities of various heroes result in different gameplay, with some characters acting as harassment, others as anchors who can protect their team and claim areas, others healing, and still others laying down large amounts of damage or inconveniencing the enemy team.

The game revolves around fairly simple battlegrounds; there are maps about capturing points while the enemy team tries to stop you; there are maps about both teams trying to capture a control point between them; and there are maps about pushing a payload through them which heals attacking heroes while they stand on it while the other team tries to stop their progress. In competitive mode, the teams switch between offense and defense on the same map, first attacking, then defending, or vice-versa.

Like all such games, this is not for everyone; after the first few hours with this game, even despite all of its seeming diversity, you will have seen just about everything the game has to offer. From there, it is all about mastery. How much enjoyment you get out of Overwatch is heavily dependent on when it goes from ""fun with mastery"" to ""tedious repetition"" for you, personally. If competitive multiplayer games bore you quickly, this will, too.… Expand"

I am really not good at the game - I make no claim to that - but I often end up having to carry (3+ gold medals per game) teams with players hundreds, sometimes even a thousand levels above me. They are just worse. They've played  the game for thousands of hours and still have absolutely no grasp of the basics.

They will fire at a shielded Zarya over an unguarded Mercy. It would make a lot of sense if most of them were bots, but then at least bots will actually play the objective.

All this is surprising considering how simplified the game is compared to other similar games. There's no ammo, no fall damage, and very simple maps.

I got Overwatch after some peer pressure from friends,  one of the reasons I was against getting it was because of major hacker problems.   Guess what, It still has hackers problems!  But the thing is; it doesn't really matter that much on open play or bot matches because you can still have fun, just don't expect to win every match.

Now for Ranked matches,  hackers should be dealt with but it seems alot fall though the cracks because of the way the characters, and skills work.   Is there a lot of hackers in the game?  Yes, in fact its fully of hackers but there are also a lot of highly skilled players who have been playing since the game launched and being able to tell the difference between them is near impossible sometimes.   You can blame Blizzard here for allow net cafes (PC Bangs) in Korea for this problem - they recently banned 20,000 accounts? But since they can create an infinite amount of accounts and smurf accounts it really compounds this problem especially if they don't get banned quick enough.

One of the things I don't really like is that fact the match making system is obviously worthless, it just doesn't work.  I'm a level 15 currently, a new player...so why am I'm being placed in matches against level 300s?  This absurd matchmaking is one of the reasons why I'm deducting points,  in a game that is 90% Competitive PvP - a proper matchmaking system is important and Blizzard fluff'd this.

Next problem is the absurd and overpowered characters,  some characters are so WTF overpowered it isn't even funny,  and other characters are almost pathetically underpowered.  But most of the time, it isn't going to matter that much at least when your enjoying the game.

I like the idea that you can get some decent stuff from loot boxes without paying, and the MTs don't effect gameplay at all, which is kinder rare these days for FPS games.

Another problem is that, honestly? There isn't very many maps,  limited variation - it seems they added a few new game types called ""The arcade"" which I haven't tried yet, but I'm going to assume if they use the same match making system then for new players, it is going to be a waste of time and will be frustrating.

The Co-op feature vs Bots is something I feel like I'm more able to enjoy the game,  and I wish more game modes was available.  Finally, it seems a lot of the reviews have compared this to TF2 and honestly,  I saw that immediately when I first played the Route 66 level, the color and style felt almost like a rip off -  another issue is that with this 50/50 win/loss ratio,  getting placed into a good team and being carried, winning several matches...then being placed into a team with wildly different levels then losing then next few matches.

In hindsight,  Overwatch isn't a bad game,  not worth $60 and I feel bad for anyone who paid full price at launch and regretted it,  I paid $40 for the GOTY edition and looking back, I feel like I should have just got the basic version and saved $10....however,  I'm okay with my purchase and this game is something I can have fun with,   new players though I don't recommend binge playing because you could quickly get bored with the repetitive maps, and loses due to poor match making.

Another major issue is the fact that getting skins, especially with the current ""anniversary"" event is way way too hard, or way too expensive.   The fact that you could easily spend $100 on loot boxes and STILL not get the particular skin you want says how offensive the micro transactions can be.… Expand"

Overwatch takes a lot of inspiration from multiple other titles, such as TF2 or MOBAs. It's not ripping them off and if you have played the game, you know this is true. The game itself blends all these influences together greatly, creating an incredibly fun gameplay loop playable for a long time. I have 150 hours on TF2 and it did get boring after some time. Now, I've been playing Overwatch for three months, I have 50 hours and I'm not even getting close to being bored. That's how good the gameplay (which this entire game is based on) is. Even after 50 hours I'm still excited to play the next round. There's more than enough variety for the game to keep being fun. It's much better to have fourteen great maps than 50 pointless mazes, isn't that right, TF2? The maps are also the only thing that gets a tiny bit repetitive. The characters themselves are vastly different from each other, original and so much fun to play. I do not understand why some of the female ones are so sexualized, but I don't let that take away my enjoyment for this game. Plus, the creators care very much about the game and address many of these issues as well as they update the game with new features, events and heroes.

The art style of Overwatch is great too. The Blizzard polish works very well for this game and gives it also some originality. Speaking of Blizzard, YOU KNOW WHAT? FORGET ABOUT IT!!!

I pre-ordered it, even, only based on the demo week we got to play it for free before release. Based on the hype and similarities to Team Fortress 2, I was expecting the game to be very similar to TF2 - more similar than it really is. Because it is not that similar to TF2 at all, and I'll likely never enjoy it as much and play it for as long as TF2.

First off, gameplay - while at first it seemed very similar (hence I pre-ordered it), after several hours it became very evident that OW is lacking the depth and skill ceiling that have kept me hooked in TF2. 20% of gameplay time there I just practice movement and explosive jumps with the help of specifically community-crafted maps, mods, and community-hosted servers. Overwatch, on the other hand, just feels easy. There's nothing you can really practice for extended periods of time; in the end, when shooting is easy, movement is easy and gameplay is simple, all that's left to improve is gamesense and teamwork. And while that's definitely worth doing and certainly decides over victory or failure, I just prefer a game that also has that, on top of very challenging aim and movement mechanics giving it that much more depth - TF2.

The other issue is how restrictive Blizzard is. No mods, no custom maps, you can't even host your own server or play OW offline. That sucks. And I mean, that really sucks. Half the fun in TF2 when I started out was to hop from insane community server to another one to see what crazy mods the community has thought of; WarioWare (with working minigames), Starfox (with working planes), Mario Kart (with working Karts), just to name a few that everyone can imagine what's going on. But there is way more, and the community was given limitless freedom to make whatever the heck they want. So we have a 30 vs 1 players boss battle mod, Dodgeball, Rocket Jump maps, Deathrun, Slenderman, and way, way more - not to mention regular but unofficial game modes such as capture the flag with only one flag.

There was even one time where I joined a community server that just seemed like a ""trade"" server (lobby-type servers designed to investigate other people's loadouts, because TF2 has a ton of cosmetic items of which you can select three on your character, plus weapon skins), but it was kind of a disguise. By accident you could discover a hidden trap door, which led to other places, all of which required an entire team of characters working together to go from place to place, and it was an extremely long way almost at the map size limit filled with puzzles and explosive jump challenges. The most important part of the team was an Engineer building teleporters because not every required character is able to traverse the same ground as others. The final rooms required you to fight through a dungeon of AI controlled, respawning skeletons while blasting away at a massive door, which could finally be opened with the help of a Demoman shooting Grenades (like Junkrat) through a vent, opening a portal that led to - a Pony village from the current ""Friendship is Magic"" show. That was the final station. It was hilarious, and one heck of an experience.

In short, TF2 is crazy diverse, and you can spend a month - if not months - not playing the same map, game mode, or even strategy twice.

One might be thinking, ""why would I want to do all this? I just want to play the game, I don't need mods."" and I agree. Overwatch is not a bad game, it is in fact quite an enjoyable one. Mods shouldn't be a requirement, and I know that not everyone cares about them. It's just that I, personally, am really disappointed with how Blizzard handled things.

If you take a glance at StarCraft and WarCraft - the games that were so mod-friendly that DOTA exists purely because of those, along with the obvious inspiration for OW being TF2 - yet, Overwatch is completely locked behind Blizzard's servers. It's a shame, really.

I'm still playing TF2 after seven years, and it's almost like I was playing a very different game back then than I do now simply because I had different preferences for game modes.

Overwatch got boring after two months. It feels like ""been there, done that"". I could potentially just keep playing competitively to improve my game, but I already do that in TF2. And that's just the much richer game for me.

Finally, I'm probably rating OW lower than it deserves (kinda). Its gameplay is decent, if it was only that, I'd give it a 7/10. But I actually HATE always-online games. I hate that there is zero possibility for mods and community stuff. OW is a poor example for a video game, because games can be much more that. Sorry.

Another issue with OW is that it wasn't programmed very well. There's always noticeable input lag unless I play on extremely low settings due to a ""feature"" called ""1 frame interpolation"" or whatever. This means 300 fps or  bust.… Expand"

The game is next to unwinnable at that point if the other team has even half of a brain. There are tons of ways to fix this. They could implement a top 5 character selection when you start a queue and at least try to find some form of a balanced team composition for you to group with. Not only that, but you can queue up against anyone within +or- 1000 SR of yourself... this opens the door for better players to offer bad players a ""carry"" which means that they go in wreck all the kids that havent got a clue whats going on and boost the other account. There are even people making money off of this nonsense... At the end of the day Overwatch is a brilliant game with great characters and fun game play but because it so heavily relies on teamwork for you to stand a fighting chance it would be really nice if they took people who solo queue games into consideration.

After having played the game for some time, desperately wanting to like it, the best thing I can liken it to is an abusive relationship.

Sure you'll have fun. The characters are all fun and cute- through no small part of the cinematic shorts (which are free btw). When the game's at its best you've got a quirky yet high intensity class based shooter with a role for pretty much everyone. The introduction of new heroes is tied nicely into the stories they create and everything generally works.

But when you actually spend time with it, good god can it be just an awful experience. As many people have said this is one of the worst gaming communities to date, and as you fall in rank people are only going to get worse. There are some awful examples of design, such as if your team has a leaver- all of your team will lose SR as a result, you can be matched against a 5-stack as a solo player, and some heroes are objectively better than others. There are very few matches that you'll win by a slim margin: 90% of games are going to be total wipes one way or another despite your best efforts. The worst part is that because the game is so intensely focused on the teamwork, one loose thread can throw the entire game off. While sometimes it won't be anybody's fault (often it will be though) something won't mesh in your team- whether nobody can play a hitscan to counter a flying character (of whom is massively unbalanced at lower levels) or whether nobody wants to switch despite being countered, or whether simply your chosen heroes just won't mesh together- this can end a game and all the way up to around mid-plat (over the threshold of half the playerbase)   people won't have the skill or experience to be able to play the amount of heroes necessary with the correct degree of teamwork. It's not fun, as often matches are simply decided by the roll of the matchmaker. The exception to this is anybody diamond rank or above as more people will willingly change and adapt to help the teamwork, but this only accounts for about 10-20% of the player base. A lot of these problems would be at least bearable if there was some sort of fix on the horizon, but Blizzard haven't even sought to address the blatant and easy fix of having a leaver ruin the entire team's fortunes- let alone anything that would require more thought.

There's also the gripe of the game not actually having that much content for a fully priced game. While you can easily make up the hours (trying to convince yourself it's worth it), it gets very stale, very quickly as there are currently a total of 4 main game modes, with 14 maps. With all the new game modes that've come out it might be considered worth it but these are removed at the end of each event, meaning that instead of keeping the events in the game for some players to enjoy, Blizzard removes it meaning no-one gets to enjoy them. The game is also an online shooter- so the only single-player mode to speak of is playing with offline bots which is not reflective of the game at all as the bots will just stand around with only their aim tweaked to suffice for difficulty. While the online-only part is a fairly obvious part of the game, it just goes to remember that full-price games used to include both single player and online content.

In short it's probably best if you don't buy Overwatch. I'll admit I was suckered in with the free weekend and the cutesy shorts, but at the end of the day the only thing you're getting is an online game that is constantly being fixed, which is at the mercy of its own community.… Expand"

It's full price when it's basically a free to play game...
Multiplayer can't be taken seriously on a competitive level what so ever since it's such a random game with so many luck based features going on at once....
Unbalanced characters. Some characters like Mcree rule while characters like Mei pretty much suck...
MICRO TRANSACTIONS! The clear indication that the game wants to rip you off...

But since Blizzard did some great games in the past people are willing to blindly call this game amazing when it in fact is pretty much a turd in more ways than not.

The game does more things bad than it does things that are good. If it was half and half I would give it about a 5 of course to be fair... But since the bad is outweighing the game... I can't give it a score over 5... It's about a 4 to be honest. But since I put my foot down hard on games like this... You know... Micro transaction/overpriced games...

Maybe it's even aOverwatch has the potential to be a good game. But there are SO many things wrong with it. For one, the lack of content. Within hours of playing Overwatch, the lack of maps and balanced gamemodes will start to grate on you, since it's practically the same match over and over and over and over, unless you play the Event gamemode, which is still restricted to once a year. Maybe it's even a one-time thing in general! This is something that Team Fortress 2, another class-based shooter, does very well. All gamemodes and all maps are playable from the get-go, aside from the Halloween maps, because, well... Halloween. Mann vs Machine, the TF2 equivalent of Overwatch Uprising is available all year long, with a free and paid matchmaking system, where you can have a chance of earning an Australium weapon, which is gold-plated, and sell it for a high price, even thousands of dollars in some instances. Overwatch has none of this. Sure, it has lootboxes, but after a few lootbox openings, you'll start to get duplicates more and more frequently, and you basically lost money for stuff you already have. Team Fortress 2 is also guilty of this, but at least you can get your money back if you sell it on the Community market or in-game trading system.

Now, onto gameplay. Overwatch is repetitive as hell. The meta will almost always take place, especially in Competitive play. There's no variety in match-ups, unless someone decides ""I should be Sombra or Symmetra and lower my team's expectations but actually turn out to be good. The meta is also extremely not fun to play against with anything BUT the meta, and that's how no-variety matches are born.

But why are those specific heroes chosen to be in the meta? Because they're much stronger than others. And this leads me to my next point. Overwatch is unbalanced. Take Roadhog for example. His hook used to be guaranteed death for anyone under 250 health, being able to hook people behind walls and objects. A year later, and it was fixed. But it's still really, REALLY, strong. Not as strong as it used to be, but strong enough to the point where it's frustrating to play against, especially if a skilled Roadhog player's playing. Bastion, Hanzo, Symmetra, Genji, Ana, Reinhardt, Tracer and many more are extremely strong and not fun to play against, while heroes such as Winston, McCree and even Zarya (without a competent team) are left in the gutter.

My next point is about the skill ceiling of Overwatch. To put it bluntly, it's very low. For one, Tracer's mobility and dodging capabilities are all thanks to her boost skill and rewind skill, which replenishes her health as well, which is frustrating, annoying and unfair in all senses of the words. Comparing Team Fortress 2's Scout, who requires health pack placement knowledge, mobility mastering and quick instincts, Tracer's MUCH easier to play and master. Another comparison, between Medic (TF2) and Mercy (Overwatch) may look as if they are the same, but Mercy has her flight skill, in which she can float over to an ally and heal them safely, whereas Medic has to constantly stick around his team while simultaneously trying not to get his Ubercharge dropped by being killed while also simultaneously trying to keep his teammates alive. Also, Overwatch is much more easygoing. When you get killed, your Ultimate charge remains the same, whereas Medic gets his entire Ubercharge meter drained whenever he dies, except if he uses the Vita-saw. He retains a maximum of 20% ubercharge. Some weapons also have damage/boost/hype meters that require to be filled up (such as the Soldier's banners) which drop down to 0 as soon as you die. Overwatch has some semblance of skill to it, but it's not enough. One button press and you're in the air as Pharah. Simultaneous button presses and a LOT of practice, and you're in the air as Soldier (TF2).

Now let's talk about hackers. Both TF2 and Overwatch have problems with hackers, but only Overwatch's has the capacity to shut down an entire match just because something isn't going correctly. On the other hand, Team Fortress 2's VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) system isn't doing very well, either. So my opinion on this topic stays neutral. There will always be cheaters.

And finally, replayability.

Overwatch DOES have some replayability and I'll give some credit to it for that, but Team Fortress 2 has a much larger replayability spectrum. I've currently put in over 1.5 thousand hours into TF2 and I've barely started to grow tired of it, whereas I uninstalled Overwatch within the first 40 hours.

Although, Overwatch does have better optimization and graphics compared to TF2, which I will also give credit to it for that and is the only reason why I didn't give it a 2 instead of a 4.

As I said in the start of my review, Overwatch has the potential to be a great game and it already is, for some players but it's just not enough for all of them.

The characters are all fun and the lore is interesting. However the game mechanics are very very very poor at closer inspection compared to other similar games such as TF2. Blizzard also has ""Not Invented Here Syndrome"".

Blizzard keeps attempting various ideas which have been tried before decades ago and conclusively determined to be bad before discovering on their own an existing known best practise or design. The management is also quite bad. By the time you have 200 hours like I have you'll absolutely hate this game. This truly is a strategy game company's first attempt at making first-person shooter. They just do not ""get it"".

One design idea Overwatch employs a lot is to make the each team responsible for their collective actions. Thus Overwatch is a game which doesn't care what ever you do in your team as an individual player. You could be the best guy to heal people, best guy to do frags, but ultimately that doesn't matter as you're not evaluated based on your individual performance. You get points by doing teamwork and the game only evaluates players how much and how well they do teamwork. Individuals aren't welcome.

If one of the mates quits the game in your team, all players, including the opposing team, will have their points reduced. It's made to disincentive leaving during a match but it just makes not so fun game when you know you're forced to play a game you cannot win any longer and you've lost interest to.

Overwatch also does player profiling where it attempts to place similarly playing individuals against each others. Do you play with people who often rage quit during a match or have done it yourself few times? Well, start expecting to see people who quit the match more often than not. Text chat a lot during game? Ok, you'll end up with people who chat a lot and don't concentrate on game. This is apparently a means to fight trolls.

How about we throw 12 random individuals of various skill levels, nationalities, languages, experiences, etc. who don't know each other beforehand and don't communicate during a match? The result is just a disaster. This is a game for groups of friends not for individual players and you will constantly lose and lose and lose and lose until you find a group for yourself. Otherwise there is going to be always that one guy who doesn't get the pacing of the team and blames everyone for the problems of the team except himself or herself and doesn't concentrate on improving the team. Also the people who ""main"" certain characters a garage who need to quit Overwatch as they've not understood the game at all.

Having just any group also won't do. It needs to be a group that has trust inside it and ability to know each character inside and out to be able to improve the group's collectivist skill cap and to support your team. That is an impossible equation.

By the way the community in Overwatch is cancer and Blizzard is feeding them. Blizzard for example banned certain words from chat because according to the community ""hurt feeling"" of people which was just ridiculous.

Technology in Overwatch also doesn't really work. I don't like the latency issues caused by data centre approach to servers. I'd prefer player controlled and owned servers. The loot box system is cancer and makes the game unfunny and unenjoyable since you cannot play the game to have skins and other costumes you want. Instead you'll receive random things and seeing constant boxes of duplicates is very very common.

What little there is music, it's great. Most of the characters are decent but some are just throughout useless and hinder the lowest common determination combination possible which might win. Widowmaker in particular because most people are not good at shooting with sniper rifle in this game. And each time you see a person select Widowmaker you know your team is going to lose. Character balance is just bad in OW and the amount of characters make sure that it's impossible to reach a balance.

Just don't. Don't get into Overwatch unless you have a group of friend who constantly keeps playing this game and you all think alike, drink same liquids, eat same food, live under same roof, etc. You will lose as an individual player regardless of your skill level and history in FPS games.

And I know it isn't a real thing in most games but in Overwatch the ELO Hell is a real thing and it exists and once you get into sub 1500s in competitive mode there is no way out from there unless you have a group of friends to play the game with.… Expand"

The gameplay and graphics style are stellar and feels extremely well polished. The fact that it doesn't include a ""single player"" or ""story mode"" is actually a plus for me, as I've found that a lot of games that have both tend to half-ass the single player and put most of their  development into the multiplayer, or vice versa. I'd rather have a dedicated team to making one truly amazing, and Blizzard has done that for me with this game.

Despite the many characters and continuous additions, they somehow manage to keep it balanced, which blows my mind.

I am absolutely obsessed and would recommend this to any fan of multiplayer first-person shooters. 11/10.… Expand"

But then I wondered ""How long it will be interesting to play this game?"".

Overwatch is not a stupid clone of Team Fortress 2 as many thought. Overwatch is much more interesting, more colorful, it is much nicer to play. In Overwatch a large number of characters that will only grow. Each character not similar to each other both appearance and gameplay. Fun to play for each character. Don't focus on one, try different characters for different gameplay (even the doctors are different). Yes, the game has gameplay similar to Team Fortress 2 (even some characters), but still it is distinctive. Overwatch can be called mobay, especially all the characters have their own special ultimate. Timely filed ultimate can change the course of the match (I will not say. that's good). You can even combine ultimate between characters of the team.

The maps where we play as different. The design of the game is good, and the game itself looks great. Let some say that cartoony is the style of the game very well. Some cards, I think. there is a certain imbalance: some are easier to win for the defense, and the other for the defense.

Overwatch refers to the type of games easy to play but hard to master. In this game, just need to have a full team. You are alone in this game will not do anything, how skilled you wouldn't be. This game decides the interaction between the team. Even if you'll play well, because teams still lose. For playing Overwatch you need to have a good team. Yeah, playing with random players is also possible, but will be less fun at times.

So how long will be interesting to play this game? I played Overwatch in a little less than 200 hours and is tired of playing games. She no longer brings me joy. The problem with Overwatch is annoying (although I won't speak for everyone). In this game there is no plot, Yes, there is lore and wonderful videos on YouTube, but that doesn't count. Overwatch is a wonderful multiplayer game, the interest of which is purely individual - someone she will hold for long, some don't. I fell in love with these characters, but the gameplay is boring, and it is very annoying that this is purely a team game - sometimes because of his bad team, you just can't do anything and only have to suffer until the end of the round. In Overwatch a lot of random moments that I just hate. I played Overwatch in a little less than 200 hours, and she gave me so many emotions, and what you want.… Expand"

There stories that just scream to us for more exploration of Blizzards beautiful world they have created.

On launch day most of us players can recall that Overwatch had a Huge shortage of content, being the only option for players to play was ""quick play"", but that was all we needed to be hooked into the game. Though what we didn't realize is that the story would soon grasp us and claw at our minds to learn more. 21 hero's (Playable Characters) on launch day with more to come, a character for everybody seemed to fit the Blizzard motto. Each character well equiped with very well crafted abilities, stylized looks, with most importantly there very own unique personality. Given that the game play feels damn near flawless its no wonder a game like Overwatch grew to be so successful, but that's not where this game shines its brightest, at least not in its entirety. Blizzard Entertainment actually put forth the effort to create a story on there Competitive Based FPS. Though there are no single player campaign element to the game Blizzard still continues consistently gives us information on the universe and characters of Overwatch, Through comic shorts or there cinematic shorts which always perks the interest of all fans of the Overwatch universe. Seeing these consistent updates and new content being added to Overwatch one might think there is a budgeting issue within there team or some sort of annoying DLC available for purchase within the Overwatch game/website, well Im here to reassure you that is not the case. Everything that is Overwatch you can get with just one Purchase of the main game, though there are micro-transactions in game you may only purchase skins in game that you may still unlock via in game currency. This effectively lets Overwatch have a very respectable and financially profitable business model that the fans and I have grown to love.… Expand"
