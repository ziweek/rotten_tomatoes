It has become a ""Oh they are that person, that means I need to be this person"" or else risk getting yelled at by a team of pent up anger filled soy boys who rather than talk little bits or trash, explode in a fit of tantrum only rivaled by Stew Shivers in 1987 in a Washington D.C. Toys-R-Us. This also stems back to a system in the game called (Reporting for Abusive Chat) Something anyone is free to report and without any drawback at all.  Want to mess with someone's account? Tell everyone in chat to report them for Abusive Chat and once 10 is reached they are auto silenced by a system that has little to no checks and balances. The way the game is structured gives you a sense that you are doing so much better than all others. To the point where everyone ends up just talking down to one another and ends in someone being a child and throwing a game just to spite one person.

Avoid this game at all costs at risk of you kicking a puppy while walking the streets, due to OSTD (Overwatch Stupid Team Disorder) You cant yell at them so you end up taking it out on the world.

Competitive isn't exactly my cup of tea since season 9. The meta is simply too harsh and people are often too serious and/or butthurt in the diamond and master ranks.

There is currently one mayor issue with this game however, and that's new content. Each event has less and less content with every year that goes by. Lucioball 4 times in a row and only 4 new legendary skins? That's a no from me. They are puting too much focus on the OWL, and the community suffers from this by the lack of content and slow updates.  The comics as well as the cinematic trailers are very hard to come by as well. The last time a new cinematic popped up was almost 9 months ago.

That's why I'm giving this game a 4.5/10.… Expand"

The matchmaking system can be frustrating at times.. I keep getting placed into late matches on the losing end.

Overwatch has a great diversity of character /'Hero's' with special powers or an 'Ultimate' power. Each hero feels vastly unique from another. I've played a total of about 40 hours in the past two weeks (total in game time - not in lobby or waiting to play). The game is superbly balanced and runs smoothly on older systems GTX 740 with core 2 duo (at least 30 fps on med low settings).

The color and contrast, and texturing of the game is far more appeasing to me than that of TF2 or Battleborn (too much color, and little shading). The maps are individually unique, beautiful and require different team strategies and hero makeup to overcome ones opponents.

I'm having a blast playing Overwatch...That said, I would not recommend buying the game at the current price of $40. See below for reasons why.

-Currently the community is irritating to play with, only 1/10 players in pick up groups use a mic.

-As a multiplayer only game, it is disappointing that there are no options to filter games. For example, I'd like to filter out preformed groups when I'm playing with a random PUG group. Also, the matchmaking for this game is horrendous. I've been placed into a game that is within 1-2 min. of the end of the match and loosing several times in a row. Further on this point, the devs have stated that match making takes into account several factors...including player performance to match. It now seems like I am stuck with players who really do not play at all as a team (no mic, no communication) and as a result my wins : loses is gradually decreasing.

-We NEED more maps. 14 maps and only 3 types of game modes (the game states 4, however, two of which are really the same thing escort vs the hybrid).

-There is little sense of progression. Nobody gives a s**T about sprays.

-The HIT boxes are larger than they appear, it creates a system whereby players with poor aim get many B.S. kills, evident by the kill cam afterwards and the occasional frag when you are clearly safely on the other side of a wall (attributable to the hitbox).

-You can shoot through your allies? WTH? I can understand no TKs, however this creates a scenario where Hanzo and Widowmaker get a bunch of B.S. eliminations without having to really place their cross hairs on an opponent..

Overall I very much like the game. Blizzard just needs to get more maps out, and create a filter system and then I would gladly bump my rating up to 8-9 which is a recommend from me.… Expand"

All the complaints about lack of balance and broken characters are the inevitable realities of an online multiplayer competitive game with a large cast and various abilities--you'll find the same complaints on any game. Blizzard is still adding new heroes and constantly reworking the existing ones to shift the balance and meta to keep things engaging, so while it is at its core the same game it was 2.5 years ago, I find myself never really getting bored, especially if you play with friends. I also haven't found another AAA competitive multiplayer title with as much amazing diversity and inclusivity--if you aren't one of those people who whines about ""too many women"" and ""how dare they include gays"" it is a refreshing breath of air to not see the same grizzled white man or sexy woman in bosom-busting ""armor"" that plagues so many other mainstream titles. The issue of toxicity is also, in my opinion, quite laughable; have you seen the LOL or DOTA communities? What playing a game of COD or Battlefield can be like? Blizzard actually takes steps to address negative sportsmanship/toxicity in its games, and although it could be doing better I find it is way more enjoyable to play Overwatch than most other online multiplayer titles. Overall, it has its balance issues, it has its wacky lore issues, the community can be a drag sometimes, but I find so much charm and fun in playing the game that I don't see myself stopping anytime soon.… Expand"

Core game design itself has a fundamental flaw though, and it makes everything so much worse; HEALING. Healing is the most important thing in this game, if you have a bad healer, a single bad healer in 2-2-2 comp, you're dead. But same does not apply to other classes, you can live with a bad DPS or a tank because they won't die if you have semi-competent healers. And... NO ONE WANTS TO PLAY HEALERS!! Most people who play them are forced to play them and it's a gamble; will they tilt because they get bored of holding down left click? There are almost none healer mains, and it's not their fault, the game is designed around healers and no one wants to play them.

Not only this but all heroes are designed in such a way that they require a healer to function properly. A Doomfist without a half-decent healer will feed if he/she is not playing against 3 tiers lower players. Same goes for almost all heroes that are not healers.

And you know what, I'm a healer main myself, and I was forced into this situation because I wanted to climb. When I realized that healing is the single most important thing in OW, I mained healers and climbed from Silver to Plat. That's how bad it is.

It's not like I've regularly seen a single player carry a whole team before, they just want to be carried and are angry their team wont pick up the welfare tab.

I won't claim to know why they're this way, I have some ideas, but in the end it's pretty funny to listen to.

I liken the game as a mix between Unreal Tournament and TF2. It's surprisingly fun but I don't think I could ever view it as an ""esport"" or whatever that is. That's not to say I'm a casual, it's just that winning is an effect, a side effect, and getting fixated on winning can distract you from the gameplay that results in a win. If you're unsatisfied with how you're playing just try better, if you're satisfied with how you're playing you're probably having fun. The trick is to try and find fun in coming up with ways to resolve unsatisfactory plays so you dont just sit in a salt pit. As to why I don't really view it as a ""competitive"" game (as to how this label to affixed onto games when its the players that make a game competitive) is because it's still a bit too random for my taste.

I like all the different modes available in Overwatch, as the core game can get a bit dull after a while. The heroes are all interesting in design. That said, i had a much easier time acquiring cosmetic gear in Paladins than i did in Overwatch, which in turn, begs to question, why does a paid game have to bait me with (mostly useless) loot to get me to play more? Micro-transactions are present in both games, but again, at least it makes sense in Paladins, as it is free. I cannot comment on the matchmaking, but i have noticed that Overwatch routinely pairs me with or against ludicrous level players. As for hackers, i've yet to meet one in either game, but what Blizzard does with PC Bangs in Korea is all kinds of shady and will eventually backfire. In summation, i think that Overwatch is good but not as good as the advertisers would have you believe. If you're thinking about getting it,  if not for anything else than ""Bragging Rights"" at least try to get it cheap, like 20$ or less (preferably) because it's just a heavily advertised, boastful moba shooter that delivers on a basic level pretty well and not much else. Paladins does all of this, with different heroes, different modes and a different graphical style, for free.  Which one is better for You is completely subjective.… Expand"

Matchmaking always wants someone to care his allies, but THIS IS NOT TEAMPLAY BLIZZARD. Mystery heroes mode is probably the least balanced thing in a game. In almost every game i had 3-6 deaths and alwas had to play stupid torbjorn, orisa, bastion, symmetra, reinhardt or mercy. I absolutely hate these heroes, but I really like tracer. And read this: I played Mystery Heroes maybe 20 times yesterday and today, and I got tracer ONLY 4 times. This is b-u-l-l-s-h-i-t. The balance updates are very rare... why? Because Blizzard always makes another events and another loot boxes filled with **** They are really not cheap, and the legendaries are very rare. Now BLIZZARD READ THIS: stop thinking your game will be always fresh, because you add a lot of looboxes and other trash. Stop adding new ""great content"" and fix the old one. In this point i thing the old overwatch was much better than this one piece of crap...

3/10 - I hope you will fix this game... pls Blizzard, I really loved it...… Expand"

But I felt like taking a chance on a game I'd otherwise decided against. I knew Blizzard. I hadn't been a fan of any of their games since Starcraft 1, and even then I played that in between other projects of mine. But Overwatch looked like it had a lot of passion and hard work put into it. So I gave it a shot.

Overwatch proved to be a waste of my money in the end. I had fun playing it for about a week and then wondered what all the hype was about. But a couple of my friends kept pulling me back in, saying I just hadn't played it the right way or something, so I kept trying. This game just didn't stick for me.

It's...lacking. In almost every way that makes every other team based shooter I've played fun. There's no real depth or complexity to any of the engagements. You know who's gonna win in almost any situation. You know exactly how to counter another person because of how restrictive and inflexible the combat is. The fact Blizz keeps adding new heroes without really tackling some of the issues with the old ones only creates more problems. And my GOOOD, the ultimates got old, so so fast. There's nothing to them. You press a button and kill or heal everything. The ONLY thing you have to worry about is timing. It's just so bland.

I've found that when discussing what makes playing Overwatch so much fun to the fans and people who consistently play it, I don't get anywhere. All they can really say is that it's generally a good game. Why? The only conclusion I can draw from this is that they like how simple it is, or they just don't know anything better. Ironically, one of the other points I'm often handed is that ""It looks good."" Dude...Quake III Arena still looks good to me, even now. It plays even better. I know we gotta get our rocks off to silky smooth 60+ fps and 2k resolution but can I get a game that plays first?? I get enough shiny looking dumpster fires from EA, thanks.

This feels nitpicky, but another point about the game I'm handed is the story. This is at least a better case to make than how the game looks, but I couldn't take the lore seriously at all. It tries way too hard, imo. Arena shooters don't need a complicated story with a deep background and interpersonal relationships for literally every character. It's neat..sure. But ultimately unnecessary. TF2 and Quake got along fine with ""group of people shooting each other for **** and giggles"". In fact, thanks to the simplicity of the premise, players were allowed to connect with their chosen character much more smoothly. They became what we made them. That's way cooler than getting someone with a predetermined history in my books. Plus, it really seems like some of the more popular characters are only so because their **** and/or asses have more 3d polygons in them; 3D jerkbait. You know? That's really **** disappointing.

TL;DR game is stupid simple. Nothing else to salvage here. Gonna go back to Quake, TF2 and Unreal. Peace.… Expand"

It is not some kind of extra feature that the developers put in as a surprise, its something it should have from the start. That's like saying that a bowl of ice cream you just made is the best ice cream in the world because it has a spoon. The reasoning is just plain flawed. Overwatch came out the exact same year other games that deserve the spot as game of the year did.
