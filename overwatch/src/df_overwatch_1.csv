Its simply amazing how Blizzard can turn a great game into total trash. This was also my LAST purchase from Blizz. Worst points:

1.	Bad and literally evil matchmaking, some games can’t be won no matter what, you cant leave the game (even quick play) because you will be matched to similar noobs again and again and again. You can’t even not play the round and wait because these noobs will report you. You just have to suffer.

2.	Terrible visual clutter, if you have problems with flashing lights DON’T PLAY THIS GAME. Even I as a healthy person get head eggs after some time.

3.	Constantly boosted hero abilities means that your team can get instantly wiped.

4.	Automatic bans where you can get banned for calling somebody a “noob”, the bans are for 2 weeks, 1 month or 2 months. Also, you can have your account disabled (here you lose your purchase!). Appealing a ban is pointless, you just gent an automatic reply from a script.

5.	Ranked matches are where you can’t rank up from your current rank to M/GM. You have to purchase a new game!

6.	In order to contact Blizzard support you have to send them a SCAN OF YOUR ID!! Do know that these game companies get hacked and don’t even acknowledge that. For my request I used a desktop screen shot and the script replied, LOL.

7.	In comparison, Apex feels much much more satisfactory and has a better matchmaking system and no punishments. The promised content for OW never arrived, game feels barren! People are also not scared to use voice or chat like in OW.

8.	I had Blizz in high regards and even donated to their cancer research, but after I experienced all their scumbag practices, I’m done with them.… Expand"

Unfortunately great visuals and audio design do not make up for the horribly flawed gameplay fundamentals. If you're looking for an FPS game to play, look elsewhere. The easiest heroes to play are the most effective 99% time. High skill cap heroes get countered by braindead heroes that can be operated by a quadraplegic. A-D crouch spam with flawed hitboxes. Maps look great, but most feel terrible to play. Balance changes are slow and based on quickplay instead of competitive play. New heroes are powercreeped and overkitted. One of the worst matchmaking systems in any competitive games. Noticeably decreasing playerbase.

The complexity of a puzzle is welcome when you can achieve control over pieces of the puzzle. This game goes too far where it should not be going.
1.The game expands and amplifies all the problems that are impossible to control making it addictive and unbelievably unfun. Even pro-scene can't achieve proper team synergy after months of scrims, what could you say about ranked gameplay of random people?
2.The game stresses the limits of poorly designed netcode too far. Because of complexity of hero interactions Blizzard has sacrificed important gameplay mechanics. First of all they butchered movement acceleration which is needed for aiming to be consistent and rewarding. Heroes in this game can crouch-spam and strafe-spam. Playing a dps hero in this game at high enough levels is incredibly stressful, you never know if you can be consistent today or tomorrow. Assembling a consistent team is also almost impossible. Because if only 2 players of the team take dps-role and if they are locked into that role - that means that consistency of 6 people team might be largely dependent on consistency of their aim, especially at higher tiers(this is only dps example, don't get me started on complexity of classes interactions and consistency of execution, it's just horribly overcomplex, it's like dota salt squared. in dota you at least can gather a team and can achieve consistent synergy) Now you can imagine what Overwatch pro-scene looks like. Like, in case of this bad design, a team has to have many dps-players, and if needed they should be able to replace each other as needed. But, in that case, how do you develop team synergy if you have so many players? Overwatch as e-sports is divided by zero.
So I could say, that the game is unfun to play, but fun to watch as e-sports. Except it isn't fun to watch either if we get into bigger picture. With the problems observed above, we can see, that it's very important to increase the consistency of outcomes in tournaments, since there is too much luck involved. Which means, that pro-scene has to play a lot more rounds in a tournament. Like three times more at least? Or we have to dramatically increase all heroes hp, like make it twice more for all heroes and somehow balance it. Tanks are way more consistent in this game on all accounts even in damage output, that's why it's broken by design. If this issue will be addressed, then we can weight outcomes more seriously. But wait! It won't be fun to watch, right?
It can become an e-sport if the netcode will become godly optimized and/or networking hardware will allow for higher tickrate and proper movement acceleration. In the current state proper Overwatch as an e-sports is GOATS or anything non hitscan, but the community does not want to see that.
You also have to buy the game while it has microtransactions like a free-to-play game would have. Blizzard were so salty about dota and wanted their own Team Fortress+Dota as quickly as possible, so they even abandoned their project Titan and started to quickly roughly somehow make overwatch with no idea what were they doing exactly anyway. ""Let's just use wc3 formula, just let's add a lot of diversity make it all flashy, then we will somehow sort it out.""
Maybe, just maybe, Blizzard was thinking years ahead. But I don't believe that. Game theory does not work that way. I would believe a story about that Overwatch core ideas were created by salesmen who don't even play games or they are really bad and basic at the games, that is why they simply threw away core fps gameplay mechanics without understanding what they are doing. And after a while they have listened to pro players talking about that the game is mechanically unfun, then they listened to devs talking about that it's technically impossible, and then they went 'ok, let's just continue with our marketable rainbow vomit'
Annd they started to add so many dps classes, so it's now progressively harder to perform consistently in dps-role, the entry level is absurd for dps-role, and probably there will be more balance changes that will shift everything again. Also at some point your main will get nerfed into oblivion - that will happen, that's how balance made by salesmen works. And you will feel betrayed for putting so many hours into playing your favorite hero. It's like taking away the reward you deserve.

Overly complex, frustratingly hard to track piece. Designed with no other thought than to attract with colors and diversity without any understanding how a competitive fps works. This **** monster can never lift off without a retarded amount of investment, because you can't attract a lot of viewers and players to something that is not even fun to aspire to. Who would aspire for a chance to be a star for only 2 years before massive burnout?… Expand"

I have played over 500 hours of overwatch, I used to have fun back then but now there are characters like doom, sombra, sigma, brigitte and moira that ruin the enjoyment of the game. These characters have a really low skill gap, are broken in they way they where designed and even some of them are op like doom that fits in both of these category.'s. Back then the only characters that where considered op and unfun to play agaisnt where sym, bastion and widowmaker and they still are  which is the worst part. Sometimes items thrown, projectiles and even bullets dissapear from the air when you die which makes it really stupid. One example of a badly made hitbox is genji's dash since the body has a hurtbox and where you started the dash has a hurtbox and other animations that require you to activatelike genjis deflect, orisa's fortify, mccree flashbang, reaper wraith, tracers entire kit of ability's have a start up timer that the game doesn't tell you or show you so while you're starting these ability's they don't work for half a second and the game even lies to you on replay's that you did not use any ability's. doom fist and his entire kit has stupid hitboxes that make no sense, when Moira is locked on into you while damaging the tether stays for a second while you break the tether that's placed on you with a wall, sombras hack which is a really stupid and unfair ability continues to do the animation and ends up hacking you even when you shoot her (which disables the hacking process) and it continues even when you try to break it with a wall like Moira's damage tether, widow maker is just unfun to play against IF the widow is decent with her since she camps back lines with heals and his team because she's a sniper and she has the ability to one shot almost all of the DPS and the healers, so you have to always hug walls against her and someone has to end up dealing with her even do allot of widow maker players are toxic and get pocketed by a healer. doom can one shot any DPS and/or healer and run away since his whole kit gives him allot of mobility, damage and gives him shields with is like extra health, Brigitte requires no skill to play even do she stuns you, hits you through anything but walls and can push you away when fighting her. There's allot more but it would take me too much time to say, but what I'm trying to say is: This game is badly balanced, terribly designed including the maps, the game is filled with toxic players and if someone throws on comp your whole team loses and reporting that person afterwards doesn't do anything but give you a ""Thank you for you report"" note which makes comp is the worst game mode in the game.

Regarding balance, Blizzard cares only aboutOverwatch has a roster of great characters (and I mean them as characters, not heroes to play as and against), is very good-looking, allows to create custom game modes and has a feature to give players something to do while waiting for their queue. However, its other aspects heavily outweight that. Yes, so heavily that it's worth 0 to me.

Regarding balance, Blizzard cares only about balancing the game for Overwatch league which works out okay for grandmaster players but is pretty much a ""screw you"" for the remaining 99% of the players. Of course screw them, it's OWL that brings in money, not players. That, or whoever is responsible for balancing has IQ far below average. For instance, Brigitte, one of the support heroes, was forced into F tier for the majority of the players in August 2019 and was only getting weaker since then. And how would you like a sniper that can't be countered because Blizzard was dumb enough to give her ways to counter her counters, removing any weaknesses a sniper is supposed to have so the only actual way to ""counter"" her is to win a sniper duel against her? And of course she oneshots non-tanks and deals very heavy damage to tanks.

Ranked play is full of throwers. Good luck getting anywhere when you constantly lose matches because your teammates decide to not let you win. But I guess it's an issue every team game will have. Anyways, if you want a competent team you'll have a much better chance of getting it in casual play.

Not that it would matter since matchmaking is terrible. It literally forces 50% winrate. You steamroll, then get steamrolled, then steamroll again, then get steamrolled again, and so on. Sometimes comes in packs of two to three.

I started playing Overwatch almost two years after its release and missed out how it was promoted by Blizzard and how it was in the beginning but I heard a lot about it being a game where you can play any role an will still be able to contribute to your team even if your aim is bad because there are heroes that aren't heavily reliant on it. Well, good luck playing support when you are a free kill for any flanker or diver. Brigitte was released as a protector for her fellow supports but she's resting on the bottom of the trash bin so it's back to free kills. And good luck playing tank when you get annihilated in a second. Barriers help with that. Or used to because Blizzard has been actively trashing barrier tanks and now two out of three are outright unplayable. Healing also helps with that but healers get nerfed. Not to mention that Blizzard is thinking of implementing a limit of one tank per team. Sure, tanks got some buffs to compensate. Some tiny tiny buffs that don't stop them from dying at a moment's notice. And damage heroes are just op as hell.

Sadly, Blizzard hasn't been about gamers making games for gamers for a long time already. And current state of Overwatch along with epic fail with Warcraft 3: Refunded actually makes me worried for the fate of Diablo IV and Overwatch 2.… Expand"

I have not found a game that has given me the incentive to keep grinding to improve, and to grow myself as a player. I've also met a lot of great friends here.

Pros
-good community, was once super toxic but has now really cleaned up
-fun to play heroes
-lots of depth, hidden under an easy to digest game that can be just as much fun for casuals as it is for the more competitive scene
-family friendly
-good esport scene
-lots of great content creators
-lots of positivity
-a constant stream of free content
-balance (both a pro and a con)

Cons
-slow updates, I would be happier with maybe one or two more hero a year and a few more maps.
-balance
-some cheese heroes can seem incredibly strong, especially at lower ranks
-people will pick on you for playing a ""dead game"" filled with an obviously massive amount of players.
-queue times because of the MMR system at higher ranks late at night can be pretty brutal, especially if you like to play damage heroes. I'm in diamond and usually find a game in less than a minute in solo queue regardless of time of day.

I would recommend this game, its lots of fun, and if you're willing to put in the time to become good at competitive and really learn the depth of the game; I think that's where it's at it's strongest. Oh, and there is no ""ELO Hell"" you absolutely can grind out of a rank. I started at 2300 and am now 3400, my wife started at 1600 and is now 3100.

I look at other games with a purely multiplayer aspect and wonder where all the money is going from lootboxes. TO start, most games like this are at least free. LoL, TF2, DOTA2, SMITE, and more. Then on top of that you can't just outright buy cosmetics which isn't a good feeling.

But the real letdown comes from the utter dearth of content. For $40-$60 you'd think they would add new characters, maps and gametypes on the regular, but no. In the 3 years this game has released, they finally have over 30 characters to choose from. LoL, an indie game(at the time) released for free with 50 unique characters.

Again, lootboxes are a cash cow for this game. They make millions on this game. Yet somehow on the regular that money disappears into thin air. The servers often glitch out and do odd things like boot you from the game, while still being able to chat with everyone in the game, or randomly swap you to the other team 3 seconds before you were about to win.

Another big gripe is the moderation. I have encountered dozens of people who just belittle you for no reason even in the non-competitive mode, but people get banned on the regular for saying ""GG WP"".

Events are the same every year. Halloween event in particular is one that was fun for a while the first year, but 3 years in a row and you unintentionally memorize the exact spawns of enemies.

Blizzard is known for their ability to tell grand stories and flesh them out with amazing cinematic sequences and character interaction to progress the story. In 3 years this game has had the most underwhelming cinematics(that you have to hunt down on youtube because they aren't even in the game anywhere to watch). The stories are often non-canon just for things like Christmas and Halloween too. In the end the world is very sparse and almost no progress has been made in telling it. Hell, half the characters have yet to have any story told.

From a gameplay stance, it is a decently entertaining casual level of competitive combat. If you want to go MLG pro, there are a couple characters for that, and some easy mode characters if you aren't super good at aiming which is nice.

Balance in the game is a joke. They have reworked one of the characters like 3 times at this point, and it makes you wonder why they can't get it right with just tweaking numbers.

In the end, this game is not worth the money no matter how you look at it. I'd just suggest playing Paladins, or find another game.… Expand"

Everytime I try the Game again I get some Rounds where the Teams are equally strong and this Games are a lot of fun, but most of the Time its either destroying the enemy team or just getting destroyed, It feels like every 5th Game is a good one and the Rest is Garbage where ur just bored by getting a ez win or frustrated by getting stomped, and what me annoys most is that Blizzard never adressed th9is Problem it seems like they don't notice but a lot of people say that the matchmaking needs a fix

At this state the Game is at least for me nearly no fun anymore

But overwtach can still be a lot of fun so try it yourself… Expand"

Blizzard's balance philosophy is to make the least effort, easiest to play characters as effective as the skill and aim-intensive heroes. Basically they're balancing around casuals instead of pros. Aim-in-the-general-direction-projectile-spam and shooting at shields, that's Overwatch in 2019, and it's not getting better. Matchmaking in competitive play in atrocious and  the role queue system has made the queue times awfully long in the high elo ranks, and depending on your region the game may be unplayable completely. Overall? Don't bother. There are much better multiplayer games than Overwatch. If you're looking for a fun shooter game, this is not it.… Expand"

Blizzard is *trying* to fix the game with role queue, which *is* a step in the right direction.

Okay.

I love the little movie vignettes... the concept art and character design... the level layout... and I love WATCHING this game as an E-sport.

But PLAYING the game is strangely awful. Only about 1 out of 10 games are close matches -- the other 9 are just steamrolls, or exercises in teeth-gnashing frustration.

I understand the IDEA of encouraging players to cooperate through complementary character roles and all that. But people just DON'T.

Regardless of how visually beautiful the levels are, you're trapped with essentially one very tired game mode -- capture the point. It's been done *to death* over the last several decades. Please, please, please continue to experiment with other options.

This tears me apart, but I have to be honest. This still feels too much like a TF2 clone; with a ton of charm and finesse, but a TF2 clone nonetheless.… Expand"

- queue times are crazy (15+ minutes to find a game is the norm in most popular modes; in less popular ones it can go beyond 60 minutes)

- queue times are crazy (15+ minutes to find a game is the norm in most popular modes; in less popular ones it can go beyond 60 minutes)
- it's extremely repetitive, and not in a fun way: you shoot at endless shields for 2 minutes then all 12 players use their ultimate abilities all at once and one team dies, rinse and repeat; Overwatch is as uninteractive as a game can be
- most maps are garbage and there is no map vote
- most maps are basically the same long tunnel-like structure except reskinned
- your weapon covers up half the screen and you can't hide it
- the matchmaker forces a 50% winrate (the more you win, the worse teammates you get); in practice, this means that all matches are one-sided stomps with only one team having a fighting chance (you know a game's bad when even winning doesn't feel good because you can clearly tell your win was forced by the matchmaker and you just pressed some buttons to achieve the inevitable outcome, losing's even worse but only slightly)
- the power level of heroes is out of balance; less than half of the 30-hero roster is playable
- the game has a report system that punishes players automatically based on just the number of reports submitted against them; what this basically means is that there is a neverending global kickvote against you that only stops when you get kickbanned and resumes as soon as you come back (!!!); because the system is fully automated, false/excessive reporting doesn't get punished resulting in people submitting reports on a whim meaning if you play the game a lot, you WILL eventually get suspended just because (this sounds like a sad joke but it's the truth; I suspect they introduced this asinine system to ""encourage"" you to purchase additional copies of the product)
- the competitive mode is an absolute joke; solo and group queues are combined (not joking!!!) and it's common to see people from three different skill tiers in the same match (a byproduct of the game having very few players left I guess, but still: this shouldn't ever be allowed to happen)
- the game is pretty much in maintenance mode; new content is sparse and typically makes the game even worse than it was before (for example, new maps they add are typically just reskinned old maps that nobody liked and new heroes are just a combination of several existing heroes which makes these old heroes largely obsolete)

The time to get into and play Overwatch was at release and ~6 months thereafter. That's when the game had a healthy playerbase and was actually fun to play. Now it's dead. $19.99 (its current price) isn't much but why flush that money down the toilet? It'll probably go free-to-play soon anyway. Plus, mobile-focused loot box peddlers like Activision-Blizzard don't deserve your money.… Expand"
