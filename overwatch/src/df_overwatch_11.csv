Ignoring this one character who is BTW NOT UNBALLANCED just really annoying to play against. I give this 10/10 simply because its the best game i'øve ever played

6,DemKin,"May 25, 2016",8,"Fun game to play with friends. ""With friends"" is to be emphasized, as the one-trick poney characters are kings on this game, the 20 tick servers might annoy you at times and the ridiculousness of the action doesn't make for a very competitive game or a game to be taken seriously at all.
Nonetheless an immediatly and casually fun game most should be able to enjoy. With friends."
7,mohbaboo,"May 25, 2016",5,Great gameplay with great characters but short on modes and I can't see myself playing it more than a couple of weeks which makes the game's price questionable.

It's a game based around 20 or so Heroes that all have 'unique' play styles, you will spend all your time either bashing your head against a brick wall as you throw yourself against the enemy in an attempt to escort (Yes.. escort missions!!! So much fun..) the payload to a destination or completely stomp the enemy into the ground, all the while playing on escort maps that become ever more choke-points that render the enemy team an even greater advantage. There is also capture the area (Most balanced) and a combination of the previous two game modes leading to a hybrid of sorts. All be told there are a whopping ... three game-modes to play in.

As with most games where you're locked into a character with unique skills and attributes there are some  who are exceptionally strong and those that are .. well.. In need of a minor buff, some tanks don't feel 'tanky' at all and support characters that are capable of dishing out the pain like a pure dps character. Almost every match-up I've had so far (It is early days yet I'll give the game that) has almost everyone choosing the sniper/dps hero's leaving me to have to pick up the slack and choose the support and/or tank.

Since all the Hero's have unique skills it follows that there is a champion who counters those skills and enables you to progress as a team, it becomes extremely monotonous when you have to rock paper scissor your way through a match, although you can buck the trend and have a team made up exclusively of one hero (Yes hero stacking is a thing, blizzard didn't learn from league of legends), which on some maps is extremely broken.

It does have it's charm however, the characters are all quirky and interesting (If lacking in the lore department), some having that edgy, dangerous look about them others are charming and cute, while some are a combination of the two, all of which are rendered in a very beautiful, stylized graphics engine. You have various vanity unlocks for each of them, from in-game emotes, skins, lines they can say and various different sprays, there is enough useless junk to collect that would give Ubisoft games a run for it's money.

All in all I would wait for the price to drop before purchasing this game, it's fun in short bursts but it has it's issues to say the least, but seeing as this is a blizzard game the price wont see a drop until sometime in the next decade.… Expand"
9,CavernClub,"May 25, 2016",10,"I haven't felt this much joy and desire to play a video game in a long time. Overwatch is a breath of fresh air.

Overwatch is a breath of fresh air.

My desire to play shooters had been slowing down for more games like smash bros and rocket league that had a little more new and unique ideas to them, so seeing another shooter being released just made me think I'll run the routine of buying a shooter, playing it the first week or two, trying to find friends who have it so I'll have people to play with I know, and then getting bored/forgetting about it until the dust settles so high on it that giving it away isn't even Worth it. But I gave Overwatch a shot and I can't believe I hadn't been excited about this before.

Upon loading up the game and starting with the tutorial, I struggled a bit with the controls. My shooter experience started with mainly Halo, Call of Duty and games the like, so not having sprint(or with the tutorial character Soldier 76 being tied to a button press) made things a little foreign. Realizing that every character was a completely different play style and had his or different kinks and actions was daunting at first, but it remind me of picking a fighter in Smash Bros., and Like in smash bros where basic such as jump, move and the buttons you press to attack so will every character control in a constant way. The defining and differentiating factor being the unique and creative abilities I've only dreamed about in shooter games.
Having so many options to choose from and learning how all work with different team makeups makes this game so refreshing. Every game brings you a new ever changing puzzle that you and you team must solve. I have never been able to play the every level the same way and I love that. I don't want an experience in a game where I know the sniper sits up here and the turret always goes here. In games like Call of Duty where people end up using the same gun because it way overpowered, the balancing so perfect in Overwatch you will almost never blame it. Every character can be countered and if the situation calls for it you area me to change characters at anytime. If a team is dominating it's because they have a well organized group and are strategizing with each other. It is up to your team to figure it out how to take the opposing team and Objective. And I can't stress enough how much your team is the most important thing. So many games try to promote teamwork but it never works they way they say. I honestly feel like if any game has a team deathmatch mode you start only worrying about how you are playing, trying to get a positive k/d ratio and you will never be able to promote teamwork. Overwatch does not let you focus on yourself. It's not about you, it's about you working with others. I found myself constantly changing characters and trying to find the best for my team and for the situation and we started dominating and the other team didn't adapt, we would win in what felt like a heartbeat. I could go on for awhile about how I don't care if you are the best Hanzo player out there, having 2-4 of them on a team while we are attacking will rarely ever work. And I say rarely for a reason; because there is no definite way to play this game. There's no easy always win team combination. Sometimes a strategy might call for 4 Hanzos' and I love that Overwatch allows for a discovery that most shooter games have never gotten close too.

You can feel the love and passion of the developers in every single detail of this game. There is nothing out of place. Every match I had, menu I scrolled through made me just feel like a kid again. I never wanted it to end. I have obsessed over this game. From something I had almost no interest in, to now wanting to spend all my free time with my wife and friends playing this game. I have a game I truly love and has refilled my passion for a genre that I believe has been getting stale. Thank you Blizzard.… Expand"

Animations are fantastic.
And most importantly, it is super fun if you have friends to play with.
My biggest issue with this game is that the current server tick-rate is sitting at a very disappointing refresh rate of 20hz meaning that sometimes you will die from bullets not registering properly which is unacceptable from a competitive standpoint, and let's be honest, Blizzard will push this game to be part of the eSports scene.
Also, the content is very lacking.

Now, from this point of my review I want everyone to understand that what I'm going to say are completely my opinions and takes on how I enjoy video-games overall, so don't take this to heart.
First of all, I'm a very competitive person, I have been playing fighting games and arena shooters for almost two decades, and what I enjoy the most of the games I play is how high the skill ceiling is and what your character's limits are and what you can do with him but, when I watch Soldier 76 mauling everyone without having to aim with his ult, Reaper's Ultimate and Bastion players sitting in one place shooting and killing everyone in sight with apparently no recoil whatsoever it's really off-putting for me.
Now, I'm not saying that these particular heroes are over-powered since you can easily counter them with another hero, I just don't like the little effort that you have to make to kill someone in this game.
I also think the maps are not that good with poorly placed health packs specially if we compare them to TF2's extremely memorable maps.

TL;DR:
The art-style is definitely my favorite aspect of this game and it is super fun with friends but, from a competitive standpoint this game doesn't appeal to ME, I know everyone is enjoying it and that's fine. The content is very lacking too.
Kudos to Blizzard for such an extremely successful game.

The only things I feel it is lacking is some game modes and not a huge variety of maps, although the maps are fun to play they do feel similar to one another and not very unique unlike the heroes who are probably the standout feature, besides the impeccable gameplay. One big thing that dropped it's rating for me as well is the lack of progression, which is an understatement. There is literally none. Levelling gets you loot crates which give you new cosmetics, that's literally it. But as I said before it has to be one of the best shooters I have ever played in terms of gameplay, not only does everything work, but it works so well together, they also fixed the few overpowered things from the beta, so no real issues in terms of balancing.

From actively listening and responding to our feedback about the game to giving fierce stances on cheating.

Overwatch encompasses all these Blizzard ideas with the same love that is given to any of their games.  The game has been transparent with what they said will be in the game since its announcement.  Everyone who remotley read anything about the game knew loot boxes were going to be sold as micro transactions after launch. Everyone knew those boxes would only contain cosmetic items that have 0 performance on actual game play.  We also knew that there was no single player and there was no ranked mode at launch.  We knew ranked would come at a later date after launch, we also knew that new maps and heroes would be added to the game for free later down the road.

The game has basically been out for months now with its beta.  Its an amazing game with great teamwork opportunities and hours of fun.

With that aside, Overwatch is a great FPS competitive multiplayer game that is easy to pick up and play.  Each character is very unique and fun to play.

GRAPHICS: Great detail and love in the maps and to the characters - its very upbeat and lighthearted and works very well with a smooth 60 FPS.

SOUND:  Great sound design with good banter and indicators as well as source to reception variability.

SOUNDTRACK: Not amazing but fits with the game for sure.

VOICE: Well voice acted with small tidbits of sayings and emotes - not a big part of the game but is well done none the less and adds to the enjoyment.

GAME PLAY: Incredibly varied and fun but released with only 4 modes and 12 maps.

REPLAYABILITY: Very replayable and is is built for replay and hopefully free updates will expand the content, but this is Activision that is publishing it and microtransactions are already present - so one will most likely have to pay for every piece of additional content.

For me the game is worth $40 and I will get $40 worth of enjoyment out of it.  If you are on the fence, see if you can try it on console or rent it for a console to see if it fits for you.  If you like Team Fortress at all, then I think you will really enjoy this title.… Expand"

The character design is Pixar quality and dripping with personality. The levels and game types are also top notch.

Only negative point for me so far is the stupidity of the player base. its extremely frustrating to pick a support class then have the rest of your team be composed completely with widow maker and reaper, despite the game telling the team in big letters that we have no tanks or defensive players. People are idiots.

But after they finish the review, they stop playing the game. So in their mind, the game will always be that much fun and rewarding, when it fact it will not as it currently stands. But they were left with a good impression just based on the first ~40 hours or so they played it and they will move onto other games to review.

RIGHT NOW, yea, the game is fun. But there is an eventual problem:

-After a couple weeks, when you're taking a lot longer to level up, the Loot Crates take much longer to come by. You won't be seeing any rewards for just playing the game. That EXP bar will be moving in very slow chunks. You'll be tempted to spend MORE money on Cosmetic Loot Crates in the Blizzard Shop.

-Blizzard better add a HELL OF A LOT MORE GAME MODES - NOT JUST MAPS OR NEW TOONS. THREE game modes?... That's it? That will get boring and repetitive real fast. In fact, it's already boring and repetitive.

-The game is not worth $40, much less $60. It should be free-to-play. It is very light on content, has zero class/loadout customization outside of cosmetics and they have a Microtransaction Shop to let you BUY Cosmetic Loot Crates if you don't even feel like playing the game that much.

These review sites are completely ignoring the long-term value of the game, of which there is very little to look forward to at the moment. They've been sucked into the intro experience and are not weighing what's to come, which appears to be just more cosmetic additions to the game.

My review? 7/10 until Blizzard adds something more to this game. Maybe even some sort of co-op PvE mission-based stuff. Only reason I'm scoring it this high is because I do have faith in Blizzard to update and improve the game down the road. They have dramatically changed games like Diablo 3 and World of Warcraft with patches over the years, so there is hope. But how far down the road?. The core gameplay engine is solid, but there is very little to do with it in this game except run around in circles shooting at other people running around in circles. And your only rewards are a random assortment of cosmetic clothing or decals for 21 different characters, some you might not ever bother playing. It's not enough to give this game legs, IMO.

there is one flaw though, and this is the flaw that is always with this kind of team based shooter, and that is the Team Fortress curse as i call it:
4 tank players,
no medics,
2 offensive players.

this is every team ever and that's because everyone wants to be the big robot that wrecks everything, and no one wants to be supports.

The way Overwatch attempts to fix this is by offering kick-ass supports that even early learners can play and that actually function as viable characters.

There's a play style for everyone.

The game emphasizes team work and going for the objective as opposed to straight up eliminations and the game is all the better for it.  You have to work strategically and try to fill gaps where your teammates roster has them, or swap to characters who can counter your opponents (see Genji as a counter vs. Bastion).  Matches last a nice amount of time ranging from 5-15 minutes which is perfect, and having loot/micro transactions locked purely to cosmetics is a welcome point.  There's no reason to do a micro transaction unless you really want to try unlocking stuff faster but otherwise you'll be all set.

Balance:

The game is far from balanced. Tracer triple dashing for a ""mine"" then going back have a very low counter play. Same goes for Bastion, the turret of Tjor or whatever the **** his name is. Hanzo throws random arrows for the hope of a bounce/ricochet that gives a kill. D. Va launches her robot for kills since her weapon range sucks, and once robot is destroyed you are almost a siting duck. Sometime you die to random **** that is being thrown as there is no initiatief to safe abilities/throwables. Free kills!

Also, since the ammo is infinite, and loading is like 0.5 sec.... there is no reason not to hold the fire button down. Hold the button down and wander around killing people you face, since they die way too fast anyway.

Map design:

The look of maps is great, but maps aren't balanced at all. Maps almost always favour 1-2 types of heroes and discourage other types. Ofc, support is always needed.

Invisible walls are also to be found. Why? No reason. Sometimes you hit a ""wall"", and cannot fly/dash over it, or past it.

The game itself is kinda boring after a long time. There is no much difference between matches. Maps do change, heroes not so often. Bastion, Widow Maker, Tracer, Mercy and Hanzo to be found everywhere.

Match Making:

This 1 plain sucks. Played 12 matches with 8 of them with the same people being thrown from team A to B and back. I cannot believe i'm getting matched with the same people over and over and over again. From time to time 1-2 players join/leave, but it's almost always the same people.

Loot Boxes:

These are expensive as hell, RNG as **** and you will never be able to get everything from just playing the game. It's a Buy2Play game, but you still need to pay to unlock skins. I'm ok with this, but not when it's random, and you are not even guaranteed to get what you want. Not even when paying for the overpriced ""Loot boxes"".… Expand"

+ If you ever played an arcade shooter like Quake, Dirty Bomb, Enemy Territory, and you enjoyed them, well then this game is for you.  It fits in perfectly with those in terms of arcade fast pace fps.

- Although there ""can"" be a high skill cap just like any game there is a limit.  Spells are simple.  Characters like Lucio have a heal and a speed buff.  Outside of timing when to use it, there isn't much challenge and reward into playing the character.  You don't get rewarded for swapping between the speed and heal, or anything of that sort. This follows with all the characters.

Characters

+ There's currently 21 and given how short games are, I was abled and pleased to play them all.  Some of them feel like clones off others games, (Reinhart = Mordakaiser) and others are copies straight from their own franchise (Torbul = Valve TF but uses a Dwarf race as an engineer)

+ All of the characters seem to have a fun addicting style of game play that keeps the game interesting.

Maps

+ There's roughly 13 (??) I've enjoyed most of them and seem to have the best action in smaller more enclosed areas then the larger opposite.

- A lot of maps have HEAVY choke points that when on attack side can feel like a real pain trying to push through 2 bastions and a torbul turret.

- Some maps seem to have dead ends (The Chinese one for example).  Also my friends and I occasionally get lost after a spawn has been moved and the walk is a good 20 seconds from the battle.

Meta

- The current pro scene seems to be playing lot of Reinhart + Mercy setups.  I don't mine Mercy has a main healer but it appear that if you aren't using Reinhart has your #1 tank, you aren't playing correctly.  I hope Blizzard nerfs him or finds away to introduce tanks better.

Performance

+ It's top notched.  The game runs smooth like butter. It feels like one of the most polished games I have played.  Joining lobbies, games, navigating the menu system, is all fluent and quick.  It's a masterpiece by Blizzard.

Overall

Best way to describe my Overwatch experience ...... It's FUN.  If you want to enjoy playing a game, pick it up. It's missing a hardcore competitive edge to it so it'll never bypass games like Counter-Strike but that's not it was designed.… Expand"

Very team based game focusing on objectives while mixing in the intensity of crazy firefights. Focusing on team position and communication is key. This game is a lot of fun and it's still fresh, once Blizzard releases more game modes then the game will just grow."

This game is fun, but won't have a long longevity for me after spending a decent amount of hours(around 100) playing this game. I will explain it as short as possible for the people who wants quick and short reviews to compare it with each other:

EDIT: It isn't as short as I thought it would be, so my appologize.

Positive:
- It's a fun and solid teambased shooter when you're new to this game:
It's a fun and fresh experience, when you're learning each maps and characters. Every character is unique, but also easy to learn/understand. The maps are also well designed enough for each character.

This is subjective and a negative for some gamers: People who wants complex characters won't get what they want. So this could be a negative. For example, Mei is a hero with a tier 4 difficutly, yet she doesn't feel that different in difficulty compared to a tier 1 character like Bastion.

- You can switch characters during game and also able to play as the same heroes as your teammates::
So you and your team can accustom to how your opponents are playing incase you have chosen the wrong hero. Or you can experiment by changing your heroes till you find the synergy to win the game. Or go crazy and have fun with weird hero combinations(even though this may be disrespectfull for your opponent).

- Teamplay is pretty important in the game:
For example, your health won't regenerate, hence you need a healer. However, you don't need a healer if you don't want to play that way, since there are healing items lying around the map with a respawn/cooldown timer. This will slow down your teamplay if everyone is scattered around to find the healing items and heal themself. Each hero has their role(attackers, defenders, supporters and healers).

- Game isn't technically impressive. However, we're gamers and the visual presentation and performance is nice and that's what matters:
It looks like a Pixar movie(not hitting that lvl, but the style is similiar) and the gameplay is fluent. Especially on the console, since it's pretty hard for developers to hit the 60fps on consoles and Overwatch is one of those game hitting the 60fps with a dynamic resolution.

Negatives:
- Short longevity for some gamers:
This doesn't apply to everyone ofcourse. But the amount of content is pretty small for a priced game. This game is only PvP and while the game is fun to play, it's all you will get(with the exception of future contents(but the question is, will that be enough)). All the heroes are unlocked and the maps. The only thing you will get are sprays, skins(some are interesting if I'm honest hehe), taunts, etc. As you may noticed, all the things I've mentioned doesn't add any value to the actual game, beside being aesthetic. All the character will play the same, meaning you won't be able to personalize your character like some other games do. Hence this longevity will be short after knowing how all your heroes plays and how to play in each maps. This is the main reason why I won't give this game a high score/perfect score like a 9 or 10.

- The game isn't complete, since the competitive gamemode will come in the next update:
Meaning, you're buying a game which isn't complete. Similiar towards SFV, but that one is far worse. This may be a trend in the future where publishers releases an incomplete game for the full price(sadly, I also bought this game, meaning I can't say much about this). Also another reason why I won't give this game an 8.

Hence my final verdict being a 7. I hope you understand why I gave this a 7 and this is my personal opinion anyways for the people who disagrees :) 7 is a good game IMO, even though it isn't a 9 or a 10. Hope I helped some people with this review. And if you will buy this game or have bought this and still read this, because of curiosity:

I hope you're enjoying your game and hope we will be teamed up and teamed against in Overwatch :P

After putting in several hours of gameplay in the beta and the release, there's no doubt that this game has great potential. It's simple, accessible, and well-polished. It is Enemy Territory polished to a mirror sheen. However, it is very simplistic. The game evokes Enemy Territory's gameplay, but lacks the experience and talent development system of that game. It also lacks any kind of inventory or character customization. That would be fine, except the classes are extremely barebones. The fact that most abilities cooldown within 2-4 seconds leads to crazy amounts of spam, and the winning teams almost exclusively include some combination of Mei and Junkrat. Ice wall spam ruins the fun and Junk Rat is easily able to get his ultimate and get 2+ kills every time. It would make sense to work off of the audio cues to try and dodge, but since his bomb-tire has so much health and can be controlled and has a massive blast range, it's hard for all but the most agile heroes to dodge. Roughly 50% of my deaths in game came from that one ultimate, even after I learned the audio cue to spot it.

Allowing multiples of the same hero on the same team, while often touted as a deep strategic choice, only encourages spam. There are enough characters with enough tactical overlap that it would not be detrimental to limit teams to one of each character. Allowing people to change characters mid-match is also a bit goofy, since the matches are only about 10 minutes long, while players are locked into the same class for 20+ minute games of Heroes of the Storm.

I look forward to the game after some balancing changes, specifically: increasing the cooldown on Mei's ice wall and reducing the damage or radius on Junkrat's ultimate.… Expand"

(Pretty sure it doesn't even have ranked play yet either, but I tell you now no one will take seriously the game is so low skill.)  What FPS doesn't have a scoreboard, as a result games feel boring, bland and you have no reason to get better when you can't compare yourself to other players.

The skill cap is so low you literally can destroy teams camping in a corner playing one handed as Bastion. Skill-less game for the casual market that will be dead in 6-12 months time.

I actually had high hopes for the game coming from a TF2 background, but sadly Overwatch is just a bit of casual fun that gets boring after a few hours. I tell you now the only reason a lot of people are liking at the moment is because it makes noobs feel like they are pro with the pointless plays of the game sh*t that you can get by just pressing one button. Game is a joke tbh.

Its definitely not worth its price tag, its literally looks, feels and plays like a free 2 play game.

Just keep in mind that this is a multiplayer only game and I don't believe that a lack of a story mode is a good enough argument against this game. Nobody complains about the lack of a singleplayer in other competitive shooters and besides, the way the game is designed I don't believe a singleplayer mode could actually be implemented well.

Overall, I'll give Overwatch 9/10. I trust Blizzard will update this game adding new heroes and maps constantly as they've promised, but the ability to purchase loot boxes just leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Afraid to create their own identity.. and This to me, is what Overwatch is not afraid of.
With its own style and its own attitude many hardcore gamers dedicated to military shooters have shown to be somewhat intimidated by Overwatch and its colourful, quirky humour.
But that is not all Overwatch is about:
The effort put into balancing not just on characters but maps too, is outstanding. Everything can be Strong. Everything can be countered

The lack of a single player campaign has bothered many but their is plenty lore out there if you need that sort of thing, you can even check out some overwatch shorts on youtube

Blizzard have put all of their love and attention into the multiplayer and it shines bright

When I first picked up and played Overwatch I gave a sigh of relief, finally something that feels natural again.
Its diverse character roster has something for everyone
If you like sniping, Widowmaker is for you, If you like face paced teleporting madness, then try out Tracer, a fan of DOOM? Why not try Pharah or even Titanfall? Play D.Va

With the game only having my two favourite TF2 modes (king of the hill (Dustbowl stylee) & payload) this game looked like a total no brainer.  My first pre-order since the Burning Crusade , I had a bit of something I needed to sort out that week so I took the launch day off as a holiday from work, great call, lovely day, sun shining - sat inside all day with the curtains closed!  So far I've put about 7 or 8 hours and currently sat at lvl 11 or 12.

The game play - it's fun.  There is no denying that.  I found it a struggle last night to go to bed on time, was always the ""just one more match!!!"", the heroes all play differently, the weapons hit with impact and audio and visuals are great.  Seems to be well optimised too, I'm running a (I think) 3.6ghz i7 with 32gb RAM and a GTX 780ti, a rig that is a good couple of years old now, however it ran all day yesterday at a solid 60fps with the graphics set to ultra.  Fantastic.  Experienced one crash (while tabbed out of the game) which required a full reboot - may or may not have been the game, also updated the graphics driver earlier on in the day.  Other than that everything appears rock solid.

After playing through a few of the heroes, I was delighted to see that the game healers  were seriously fun to play.  Got a few hours in as Mercy then finished off with Symettra, missing my ubers abit but that mass res is awesome.

The main problem I see with this game, and for me it is a huge deal breaker - the match making.  I hate match making systems like this, COD & Battlefield like.  With TF2 I have a specific server I play on (donate to also) and as such I play with the same group of people every night.  Usually there is about 70% regulars and 30% tourists.  When you log onto the server, people say hello.  You know who are the good players and who to avoid, who plays what etc.  The voice chat banter can be fun and entertaining, depending who's on.  With this your just thrown into a group of total randoms.  Unless your running premade groups.  I can see the pre-made groups of friends steam rolling random groups.  Think TF2 with permanent team stacking and no scramble.

Also there does not seem to be any ""skills"" like sticky jumping & rocket jumping etc.  Everything just seems to be button bound.  Which is a shame, I may be wrong here though.

How big these issues actually are, only time will tell.  Right now, I can't wait to get home and rock a few more matches.  A month down the line...  I'll probably have gotten bored with this and gone crawling back to TF2 - not because it is a better game (it is though, in my opinion), purely because - all my friends are there and the game just feels more skill based.

They really need to enable mod support too.

I've been playing this game since the very beginning of closed beta in October, and 10 minutes were enough for me to understand: this will be a huge hit. Playing this game in beta and writing feedback on it were a whole adventure for me and a lot of other people, but now it's history and a subject for another discussion. Let's talk about current state of the game, when it's already released!
But first, let's discuss the most controversial topic of all - game price. Why it's bloody $40 bucks (that is if you are happy PC gamer; it's whooping $60 on consoles)? Simple, because you're getting everything from the start. No locked abilities, heroes, maps, modes. Just think, what's best for you: pay up $$$ now or bleed money throughout the whole time you'll be playing? $3-$5 bucks per character, $10 for some monthly exp boost is already enough to end up with the same $40-$60 bucks paid just in three-four months. And it's not all, obviously, you need to pay more to keep up with the game. More characters on the way, more months coming... And it'll never end, just admit it. But here, in Overwatch, you have everything from the moment you launch the game for the fist time, and you will get future content updates, because you already paid for it. You have to understand that Overwatch, like many other games today, is work in progress, it'll never stop to evolve. Maps, modes, heroes - you will just have access to all of it once it'll be released. And it's awesome; for me it's easier to pay fixed price ahead and never worry about money for future updates.
Alright, let's talk about the game already. It's class-based shooter, which means, to simplify things, a hybrid between Quake and some modern MOBA. You have an awesome, skill-based and fast shooting merged with variety of abilities and mechanics, different from one hero to another. While first part, shooting, is basically the same as in other arcade shooting games, second part, different classes with different abilities, deserves deeper explanation.
Imagine, that you are playing Zarya, a tank by in-game definition, designed to push enemies back, withstand some considerable damage and shield allies for a short time. Her weapon has two modes: particle beam, which does damage if you pointing it on enemy, and projectiles, which explode and do some damage in an area. You can charge weapon by absorbing damage with barriers, which are in a short cooldown, and increase damage output by 100%, which puts her damage in line with offensive heroes, which do same damage by default. Pointing beam accurately on an enemy and hitting them with projectiles, plus absorbing damage with barriers requires some skill, at least it's not that easy to do, but once you master it, you can really outdamage everyone in your team, being both a tank and mvp-damage dealer. That was the shooting part.
Now for class-based thing: you are a tank, which means you are tough; half of your health pool is rechargeable shield, which restores really fast while out of combat, and most importantly, you have barriers, one for you and one for your teammate, they help you to stay alive and charge you weapon in the same time. But the most important thing about playing Zarya is utilizing her ultimate ability. Ultimates are different for each hero, they are charging over time and in combat, and once used properly, can literally change the flow of entire round. Zarya's ultimate is one if the most useful for teamplay and combines really well with a lot of others. What it does is simple: it grabs every enemy in an area and holds them together for 4 seconds - more than enough time to kill everyone who got caught. And thing is, using this ability properly is crucial to break entrenched enemy position, and Zarya player and his/her teammates will be very well rewarded if they coordinate use of this ability very accurately.
I've wrote all this to show you that game is not that simple as it looks if you glance at it for one or two minutes. Every hero and every map requires studying and learning, you can't get to the bottom of this game in two minutes of playing. It's essentially ""Easy to learn, hard to master"" - famous motto of all Blizzard games. I've played Overwatch for more than half a year now, and I still finding some little things to help me improve my game even more.
Also, it's the most fun game to play with friends I've ever seen. Admittedly, Overwatch is really un-fun to play alone; I suspect that's why so many reviews are negative. During open beta I've managed to get full six-people premade, and omg it was awesome. The best two hours of gaming I ever had in my life! Hoping to repeat it some time.
P.S. And didn't even mentioned many other pros of this game, such as incredible overall quality and breathtaking art, but those 5000 character coming to and end.
P.S.S. Sorry for more than possible grammar errors, English is not my native language!… Expand"

This is a highly polished game where all the characters have distinct personalities and some depth to explore different tactics.
Team play will make or break your matches and combining the different characters' strengths is crucial to succeed in this game.

Overwatch should be an example to every other game developer on how to launch an online game with no issues on day one!

Be sure to check out the content included in the game before you buy though. It's enough for me but it's understandable if some people feel like there's not enough content yet.… Expand"

This shooter is addictive, light to play and just plain fun.

It's just SO satisfying to play a multiplayer shooter that doesnt feel like a new COD... A game that, maybe isn't that innovative, but offers you a solid shooter experience merged with team based objectives and character-specific powers.

This isn't the ""I choose one char and keep on playing it"" kind of game. The chars are all so fun, charismatic and unique that you want to try out all of them...and keep on switching during your gaming sessions.

Only downside (so I would quote 9) are the character models. Don't get me wrong... The graphics are beautifull but I kinda feel like they're a little bit to manga-ish for me (I know manga fans will think otherwise and say they aren't manga at all).

The fact that this is a game WITHOUT A SEASON PASS let's me add 1 point to my quotation! We want extra content yes, but don't publish a half-done game like SW:BF just to be able to ask people money for season passes right away...

Bloodborne was great, Dark souls 3 even better... -OVERWATCH IS FANTASTIC-… Expand"

- Long time between matches. Long post match screens, long hero selection and long ""warmup"" time.
- Playing to looking at menu time ratio is 50:50.
- Very casual, there is no real learning curve and because of this even great player will be killed by one of too many ""luck"", ""no skill required"" shots from novice player.
- Microtransactions... I just don't support them in full AAA price title. This game looks and feels like a F2P game (F2P with micro transaction is acceptable for me).

BIG PLUS:
I requested refund as this game didn't suit me well and Blizzard wasn't making any problems.
BIG PLUS for their customer support.… Expand"
97,supermanultra,"May 25, 2016",5,"It's okay, but not for a full priced game. Not much content, extremely repetitive after ~5 hours, and the skill ceiling is insanely low. Clicking Q and killing the entire team isn't very fun or skill-based."
98,z6v,"May 25, 2016",10,"This game is extremely polished, fun and accessible and was worth every one of my 60 Australian dollars for the base edition. After over 2000 hours in Team Fortress 2, I'm very impressed at Blizzard's shot at a class-based shooter."

The graphics, sound, ui and design are up to usual Blizzard standards, that is to say incredible. The game plays great. I haven't seen any lag and the game actively encourages positive attitudes and teamwork over COD style K/D obsession.

Fantastic work all round. As for those people complaining no campaign, this isn't Brink. It's what Brink should have been.… Expand"
