And skins here matters nothing.

Also people hate matchmaking, and of course they have some reason for it. But your skill is matter too, and if you are really good, you will increase your rating (for example, I raised from 2000 to 3300 for this 6 months).

During those times, do you still remember joining random servers on and on and on, hoping to find some equally skilled players to play with and have some fun? Yeah, me too. Good times.

But... you also remember joining those servers where you got absolutely bulldozed by a seemingly ""too"" coordinated tight-knit group of players. What was their advantage, you were thinking back then? Were they using a program like Team Speak? Maybe they were a group of friends playing together in the same room? Or maybe they only played this one map for hundreds of hours, using the same general tactics and you just stumbled on their server. Or maybe all of the above.

I remember I had a choice back then, I remember being able to choose for myself that I didn't like playing with these players, because there was no fun to be had for me. I couldn't hone my skills or perfect my tactics by observing them make the same moves every round, with the same weapons, with the same classes, in the same order, every single time. There was nothing te be gained on these servers. At those moments, I didn't realise the luxury I had of simply exiting those games and joining another within 10 seconds.

This game takes away that basic luxury.

As mentioned before by other reviewers here, this game forces you into games where the end goal is to have everyone maintain a 50% win rate. Sounds good on paper, right? Everyone has a 1 in 2 chance to win the game. Sounds logical. You win some and you lose some.

But read that sentence again:  ""the end goal is to have everyone maintain a 50% win rate"".
What this game does, it will disregard your personal and in game skill level and forcefully match you against players who are overwhelmingly more skilled than you, or match you up against a a seemingly ""too"" coordinated tight-knit group of players (which is visually indicated in your game) when you're on a winning streak.

You feel that cold chill yet?

Yes, this game willfully puts you in a meat grinder against individual top-tier players with hundreds of playing hours or clans of 3, 4, 5 or 6 players, because the game deems it is now ""time"" for them to win their next game. You are the sacrifice in achieving that goal. There's no way out of this circle. If you make the choice to exit this game, you will get a ""leaver penalty"" if you repeatedly keep leaving these kinds of games. When you join a new game, you will (again) get matched up against similar overwhelming odds. Until it's your ""time"" again to win and get matched up against a random group of lower skilled players.

It's maddening to play this game where the odds of you winning or losing are calculated and manipulated beforehand. In the end, you feel like you don't have any control on the outcome of the match.

In closing, this game fills me with an almost unbearable sorrow. From afar, the production values of this game are sky high. Excellent art style, good sound design, interesting characters/class mechanics, stable engine, etc. Yet their choice to not let you choose your own servers and the inclusion of this fixed matchmaking will be the reason many gamers will leave behind this game.

When Overwatch someday decides to give players the freedom to play with similar skilled players, you can up the score of this game to a 7.5 out of 10. There are fun times to be had, on the very rare occasion 2 teams of equal skill do get matched up against each other.

P.S.: Oh, and ""Quick Play"" in this game means waiting up to 3 minutes to start/find a game with other players. Remember 2 weeks ago it was publicized there are 25 million registered players in this game. Even if you look at that number from an extremely pessimistic view and guess that about 1 in 250 registered players still plays this game, you still would have 100 000 active players. It should not take 3 minutes to find you a game with those numbers of people.… Expand"

One of them is that this game really shouldn't be 40 dollars, or even 60 just because you get a few skins. I believe Team Fortress 2 was 20 dollars by itself when it came out and it was 50 in the orange box bundle that came with Half Life 2 and Portal 2, but you actually owned those games and didn't need to connect to any servers to play the game. You can't even access your settings if you're not connected to the internet. I don't see what justifies Overwatch's price. It hardly has any content at all and the content that it has is flawed. It should honestly be about 20 dollars like Team Fortress 2 was. The add special gamemodes like Lucio ball(basically soccer) and Junkensteins Revenge(AN ACTUAL HORDE MODE THAT PEOPLE WANTED) which were actually unique gamemodes....for a few weeks...and they're never seen again. Why do this? They also have a feature where you can buy loot boxes to unlock cosmetic items, while including the feature to find them via leveling up, which is a total grind fest and you get sprays and voice lines out of them 90% of the time. The feature to find cosmetics via leveling is completely redundant when it takes about an hour to level up once if you're doing decent, and not all of us have the time to sit and play for longer than two hours every single day.

Ranked is very poorly designed. The way ranked works is if your team wins, you go up in rank. If you lose, you go down. And win streaks and loss streaks effect how much you earn and lose. This seems well designed, but then you realize you need to rely on 5 other people to cooperate with you. This doesn't happen very often and people just want to argue or not cooperate at all. Players also like to blame each other and refuse to switch heroes when they aren't working out well. A bastion player will die because he's completely immobile and blame his team, or a Widow/Hanzo will never kill anybody because of a massive rein shield or their Winston keeps jumping them, and then they blame their healers or even the whole team when they were the ones in a bad position as bad heroes for the situation. These players end up leaving eventually in the middle of the game, and then the enemy team ends up with a man advantage and the game becomes even more one sided because backfilling isn't allowed in ranked.

Quickplay is almost exactly identical, but doesn't involve ranks. There's also the added benefit of being roasted by your team whenever you ask them to switch or to simply stand behind your Reinhardt shield(so they don't die) because ""bruh it's just quickplay"", which is just excuse to perform poorly.

And then there's arcade mode which is horridly unbalanced and only exists to make it look like there's more content, but it's literally just quickplay with randomizer, except for the 3v3 mode. I'll admit that 3v3 is pretty fun at times, but that's only when you have a friend or land with somebody who cooperates, which isn't often because arcade mode is a barren wasteland and it takes 5 minutes just to find a game. The special capture the flag game mode right now is absolutely broken and ends in a draw about 90% of the time it seems unless the enemy team is stacked with people in a group, which is honestly the only way to really have fun or win consistently in this game.

The only good thing I really like about the game is some of the characters themselves. The characters have a lot of personality and different skills to make each one unique, but some, while not broken, are not enjoyable to play against. Mei and Symmetra are the biggest offenders of this(And D.va before the January patch). Mei is capable of placing down an ice wall which can separate players from their team so they get singled out by the team. It's very hard to overcome this on certain maps without a cooperating team, which you usually won't have. On top of that, her gun slows and freezes enemies which sets up for an instant kill on most heroes. She's typically called one of the best one on one heroes in the game just because of this, only really beaten by Mccree. On top of that, you have Symmetra who can easily 1v1 most flanking characters that could potentially deal with Mei, as Symmetra has a lock on weapon that melts most heroes like ice cream and has a surprisingly long range that can reach you while you're on the other side of a truck after it's already locked onto you. You have to severely outplay the Symmetra if you get caught by surprise as most of the heroes in the game. These characters aren't necessarily overpowered. Symmetra isn't that good in fact, but they're still not fun to play against and they'll win a 1v1 fight in most cases just because you didn't see them first.

The game lacks content, has bad matchmaking flaws, and toxic players. The game can be fun with friends, but it's just very bare bones and below average for a 40 dollar price, or $60 for some reskins. GG Blizzard.… Expand"

At the first glance, the game is very good: distinct and colorful visual style, diverse cast of characters to play, admirable amount of polish and quite a few maps. It is important to note that Blizzard doesn't abandon the game and continues to add new maps, game modes and characters free of charge (so far). This is a shooter, but there are ""aim in the general direction"" characters, so, even if your accuracy isn't that good, you won't feel helpless. Playing with friends is preferable, but going solo doesn't really ruin the experience either, since the community isn't all that bad. Sure, you can run into some toxic players once in a while, but they can be muted, chat can be hidden and those players themselves reported (although, reporting system is far from perfect - 5 premades you play with can easily gang up on you). Matches are quick (usually 5-10 minutes long), so even if you lose, you don't really feel the blow. Matchmaking is on and off kind of deal - if you play in off peak hours, your chances of being stomped or run into some inadequate players increase; in peak hours, it's rare, but still happens once in a while.

However, after having played around 100+ hours, the game's lack of depth is starting to show. The characters are pretty straight forward - once you've learned how their gun and abilities work, you have nothing new to discover. Same goes for the maps. After a certain amount of time, you know how the match will unfold, where the enemy will come from (sometimes even in what formation) before it even begins. It gets tiresome even though I didn't play this game on daily basis for hours at a time. Despite Blizzard's continuous support of the product and updates, there isn't anything that would make the game feel interesting again (I liked Halloween Terror, but that was an event - can't play it now).

Overall, the game is good, but designed for more casual play. If you want something you can play once in while, have a bit of fun and be done with it - you should buy it during the sale (I'd recommend going for standard editions, since the skins in the Origins edition aren't even that good). If you're looking for a game with high learning curve, complicated mechanics that can still give you something new even after hundreds of hours played, you better look elsewhere. In the end, I got my money's worth, but there are f2p titles that can do basically the same thing (TF2, Paladins).… Expand"

33,SlackIsBack,"Jan 15, 2017",1,Cheap class-based team game that tries to be TF2 with less depth. Matchmaking is by far the worst aspect of this game with the way it constantly places you with people vastly below or above your skill level. The game is much less of an FPS and more of an MOBA-style ability spam fest. Short matches and long wait times between matches leaves you frustrated and feeling like your time is being wasted.

Quick play mode seems like place to just mess around (that is what VS AI, or the practice range is for), and you would think that this would not be the case in ranked play, but it is. the current ranking system does not seem (in my opinion) to accurately reflect and or adjust for skill gap disparities, so its really hard to judge how good x player really is. My question is how can you expect to climb the ladder in solo que? I am a bronze player, (Silver season 2), and its like your stuck in SR heck. Its seems that all the levels are like this to an extent. It's also very misleading when you find a group that seems to play well, and you all group up together, and then get crushed because teams are so much more coordinated than what you thought your team was. Its seems that sometimes the only way you win is because the opposing team is just way worse than your already terrible team; its like a challenge of who can be the worst, instead of who can be the best.

I had a blast learning every corner of the maps. I had a blast learning most of the heroes. I had a blast experiencing the full circle of human emotions, from joy after a hard win, anger and sadness after losing. It really is an investing game, .... or so I thought until I hit a problem TF2 never had.

TF2 could switch up the ways one could enjoy the game. You could play the way Valve meant it to be played, but not only. If you wanted to go for a more casual experience, you could. If you wanted to be really competitive, more than intended, you could. If you wanted to improve some skills while still having fun, jump maps or sniper only maps were there for you. The list goes on and on....

Overwatch doesn't have that. Meaning that no matter how great the game might be, if you're looking for more than the simple package given by Blizzard you'll have to pass.

But the real problem I had after 300 levels in Overwatch was the skill ceiling. After they removed edge dashing with Genji, there are no more tricks you can learn to get any kind of advantage in the game (they are legion in TF2)
These kind of tricks, while giving you slight advantages, used to make me feel like I was progressing, that I was getting better at that game. Having no such thing in Overwatch means that you will feel powerless, like you're not progressing at all. The fact that you depend so much on your team doesn't help that feeling neither.

In short,if like me you've REALLY liked TF2 and its diversity, you will be left disappointed in Overwatch. If you were looking at TF2 for a competitive experience, you found your game.

This game was one of the worst parts of the year 2016. It is thoroughly un-fun in every way imaginable. The characters are unbalanced and uncreative. The whole premise of the game is basically a Team Fortress 2 clone. It is based entirely on team play, but there is no incentive for working together as a team, and no way to punish players who troll or do not work with their team. Overall, I have had a highly negative experience playing this game, which I have been playing since release. And I haven't even gotten to the worst feature yet: competitive play. I realize Blizzard changed competitive placements in Season 3 because Gold and Platinum were overpopulated, and they wanted to fix this. That said, the fixes they implemented were the worst possible. In Season 2, I placed silver and stayed about the same throughout the season. However, I played a lot of quick play and other modes between Season 2 and Season 3 and improved quite a bit. When I played my Season 3 placements, I won 7 out of my 10 placements, earning 3 or more gold medals in every game except for one. Obviously, this means I not only won games, but significantly contributed to the success of my team. Additionally, I was matched in every game against people who had already placed in gold or in platinum. The fact that I did well against these players shows that I deserve to be placed in a similar skill level to them. However, I was placed in bronze. I feel the changes that Blizzard made to competitive essentially just places every player lower than they deserve to be because they could not think of an actual solution to the problem. This removes all motivation to play competitive, because good players are going to be placed lower than they should be, which feels bad and is not a reward for playing well. Additionally, it is going to be much harder to climb to where you really deserve to be because you will be placed with people who are not as skilled as you are. This also creates much more unbalanced matchmaking. Overall, I feel this game is not very creative or fun, and the little potential it did have was completely ruined by the utter stupidity of Blizzard as a company. I would NEVER recommend this game to anyone, and it has certainly been a waste of my time and money.… Expand"

To summarize, Overwatch is a hot steaming crappy liquid garbage mess of a game. It steals mechanics and features from a bunch of places such as: The gameplay of TF2, the MoBA mechanics of League of Legends, and the graphics of Disney Studios (?!).

TF2 is easily one of my favorite games. It is amazing and I simply love it to bits. However, Overwatch is just a poorly made ripoff of TF2, and not nearly as good.

I have so many complaints about this garbage game, I don't know where to start. First off, it has practically NO CONTENT. 3 gamemodes, and like 4 maps. That is simply pathetic. It tries to be funny or humorous by having a goofy stereotypical British character that says cringe stuff like, ""CHEERS LOVE! THE CAVALRY'S HERE!"" Absolute fail.

And the price?! REALLY?! $60?! What a load of bullcrap. I actually thought that was a joke at first, but apparently Blizzard DOES want to overprice this stupid trash game.

So overall, Overwatch is simply a disgrace to both the FPS genre and the otherwise awesome array of Blizzard games, which is strange, since they're the one who made it.

Just do yourself a favor, go play TF2 for free instead of wasting $60 on this obsolete garbage.… Expand"

1- some characters are so easy to play.

its super annoying that you know you just got killed by some random clicks. for example, there is a bomber and all he does is randomly spamming infinite granades across the map. no aim, no well spend ammo and fairly low cooldown of reloading. this isnt only character does this kind of things, many characters, in fact, requires no real thought or skill to play good. blizzard apperantly wanted a easy to play, casual game but i think they did way too over the top. if you can walk and click you will for sure, get kills eventually. its that much easy.

2- it too dependant of teamplay, and game doesnt help you to have a good multiplayer experience.

there are roles such as like tank, support etc etc, and people can pick anything they want and actually this is a huge problem. why? if you value teamplay like me, half of your games will be about filling empty role spots in team. noone picked tank? you know you should pick a tank.. irresponsible players wont be sharing duty and you will sacrifice your fun more times then you can guess.

also, you can encounter players who insist on playing characters they are bad at till forever, and its annoying that you know there is nothing preventing it. you see this guy, picking hanzo and playing terrible with, but still insisting on playing it for hours and hours, game doesnt provide any options for you to handle this frustration... it just lets it... because well blizzard wants it casual as much as it can be.

3- some hitboxes for abilities, or attacks, are ridicilously large... its too casual. at first i had great respect for some hanzo & roadhog players but later i found it was just too easy to make headshots with those caharaters. hanzo, the character which is supposedly a sniper, hits your head just by aiming your upper body.

4-it doesnt matter if you spend your coins carefully on legendary skins and content alike.

they sometimes give free and absoloutly super looking skins that makes your legendary skin look thrash compared to it. for my genji, i purchased most expensive skin but blizzard recently decided to give away a brand new better skin for everyone who plays a few games in Heroes of the Storm. why did i even tried to collect all that gold then???

casualness of blizzard destroys a brliiant potential... if you are similar to other recent blizzard games its a common thing now. daiblo 3 suffered same things.

my final score: 6/10. blizzard builds it and destroys it all by themselves. i dont reccomend spending money for this game, its allready overpriced and its not good enough to keep you playing if you look for replay values.… Expand"

The good part is that it will last for a few years at least and we are going to receive updates and new features from time to time.
