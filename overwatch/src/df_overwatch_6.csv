- Incredibly fun to play as a team, whether it be perfect balance of defense, offense and support or six Winston tanks running in with primal rage for a super strike. Seriously, it's fun.

Positive:
- Incredibly fun to play as a team, whether it be perfect balance of defense, offense and support or six Winston tanks running in with primal rage for a super strike. Seriously, it's fun.
- Fast paced and easy to maneuver around. Very few times have I gotten bored because the game was too slow. Everything is quick and leaves me with an adrenaline rush when I'm a lone Lucio on the payload in overtime with a Reinhardt-Mercy combo running at me.
- Easy to play most characters; rewarding to play those that are not. Bastion, essentially a sentry gun that can move and repair itself, can be used by pretty much anyone who plays Overwatch. While heroes like Zarya can take time to learn and use effectively.
- Runs very well on my computer. Not sure if it's just because it's powerful, or the game is very well optimized.

Negative:
- Matchmaking can sometimes take a while. I've sat in a Skirmish for five minutes before. While that's not a seriously long wait-time, I can sometimes get into a game in five seconds.
- Some things feel unbalanced to use and fight against. Reinhardt's shield is incredibly powerful and can defend the entire team while Bastion sets up right behind him and mows every single person down. Very good for both defense and offense, but seemingly unfair to defend or fight against.

Overall:

Incredibly fun to play and get into, especially with friends. The price tag on the Origin version is not worth the extra skins and items you get for buying it. Stick with the base, $40.00 version and you'll be absolutely fine and dandy. In the twenty hours I've played, I haven't come across any hackers. That's not to say there isn't any, but is part of my experience.… Expand"

The flow of gameplay is schizoid; Disorganized to the point of painfulness. It wouldn't be an issue in a typical FPS game, but the format of Overwatch calls for some degree of organization which is not fulfilled by playing with randoms.

The game doesn't lack content. It's just bad. Think of it... A lot of FPS games could survive on one or two core maps. Content is then created by player interaction. If those interactions are fun, you have a near endless supply of good content.

A lot of people do play Overwatch, but if it wasn't backed by Blizzards advertising wallet it wouldn't be popular. (Or maybe perhaps if their current formula didn't ""work"" they might be more consistent with their products.)

I won't deny that Overwatch is fun when teams ""click."" It's probably a blast with a regular team. Maybe it'll be more fun when the playerbase has more experience, and the metagame matures...

...But in my eyes Overwatch is ****e right now.… Expand"

It is certainly not a 0 like other user reviewers are saying ,however it's not exactly perfect either.

There is practically no story in the game, the only story are animated shorts and comics from outside sources to help build the world of Overwatch. And while these are made with the high quality one would expect from Blizzard, the game itself lacks any sort of explanation to who these characters are and why they are capturing points/pushing payloads.
However, what little story there is can be found in Easter eggs, character dialogues and before mentioned outside sources; these story elements helps makes our 21 characters more interesting and engaging. and i wish Blizzard would have fleshed out the story with an in game campaign.

Gameplay is where Overwatch excels in my opinion. This is a team focused game and Blizzard have design the game around teamwork. Not once have I ever felt that I wasn't contributing or I was carrying my entire team. The maps are creatively designed and the gamemodes, while very basic and simple, have been balanced and polished out to a high standard. There are 22 (as of Sept. 25 2016) playable characters with more on the way and each of these characters feel unique and useful, even the supports have cool healing abilities and can kill anyone.
There are 3 main gamemodes: Quickplay, Competitive, and Brawl. Each of these have a variety of maps and objectives to do, however they may get repetitive after a while since the objectives are just attack/defend points and push a payload. And since these are the only gamemodes for now the amount of content will seem lacking for now however Blizzard have promised more for free in the future so that will really decide the worth of the game

In terms of microtransactions, the game can be played without spending more than the premium price. The microtransaction are lootboxes that you can either get from leveling up or buying them with real money. However obtaining lootboxes by leveling up gets much harder for lvl. 40+. But the only thing these boxes gives are cosmetic skins, sprays, player icons, and voice speeches; lootboxes are completely optional so it won't give any gameplay advantages if you buy 1000 of these to someone who hasn't spent a penny.

Overall, Overwatch is a great game to mess around with friends. And while the content so far has been lacking, Blizzard's promise of free characters and maps has helped ensure me that content will keep coming for many years to come.
I recommend you to buy this game at $40 if you love first-person shooters, teambased games, or have a bunch of friends to play with. (Note: If you can, don't buy the origins edition. It's $20 for a bunch of skins that aren't really special compared to other skins anyone can get. Buy the normal edition)… Expand"

So i took a souvenir during F2P beta day (memories of potentially fun, simple game that looked like polished Battlefront or Team Fortress but was still more than that; more unique in a way as far as heroes and their abilities went). Sadly, that was all just a minigame, simple and unfinished but addictive enough to bait you into the real game that's hidden inside; and  what hid inside was a very, very dark place, exactly the same place that you can find in the Cs:GO or many modern games, and a place that will exist as long as 1st world players (be it 13 or 60), except to be treated like addicts, even when they're not, it's aimed toward those prone to addiction, vanity, and gambling. Those are the customers that every modern company aims for these days, and sadly, they keep coming back to play their slot machines, even though we all know ""the house always wins"". But unlike dangers and unappealing aspect of gambling and specifically slot machines, where everything and everyone warns you that you shouldn't spend money playing it, this road is paved by people shilling the game for you, You tubers with fake personas that ride every hype train and play along to the tune of the companies for their micro-share of the micro-pie, to soothe the vanity  and get their taste of fame, they will guide you to these games with fake ""omg amazing"" reviews, much like gaming journalists, only with more popularity and less rich vocabulary; there are no grannies with crutches standing in front of these slot machines, only people surrounding you pm-ing how cool you look in this or that skin, voice (new feature yay!), spray tag.""Just cosmetics"" just became part of your social/gameplay xp.
Most games today, especially multiplayer ones, are just 1 hour expiration date minigames that guide you into the real game-online gambling, with everything produced by other fans and players, but restricted to people because you sold your soul at the start of the agreement policy, and everything you produce while playing or being inspired by the mini-game can be recycled, and will be recycled, as a new product you have to pay for, be it maps or ""mission packs"", but it is all focused and boils down to the gambling aspect where you roll for cosmetic features that games are centered on, and you receive by leveling (10% of them) or spending infinite amount of money (and I do mean infinite, the more you spend and obtain the lower the chance for the skins you don't have but want to drop, to drop). Online gambling trap=1/10; Minigame called Overwatch you will get bored by in first few hours: 7/10 (could actually be a promising game, but don't be fooled to think you can ignore the ""it's just cosmetics, silly"" because the game is all about those cosmetics, and everything will guide you to focus on obtaining all those silly cosmetics).
TL;DR I cannot put this simpler: DO NOT BUY THIS. Just because you trust Activision-Blizzard (as good old Bobby Kotick said, explaining the WoW corpse yearly remakes: ""If we cannot run a game into the ground, we don't want it"" meaning if the game isn't addicting/cool enough for people to deal with micro-transactions (understatement of the decade=straight up ego stroking for money) and addiction/vanity mechanics hidden inside, we don't bother with it. This quote explains a lot about the inner workings of the gaming industry, and that means any company,not just EA and similar designated meanies, they ALL work on the exact same business model from Valve through ActivisionBlizzard to EA, with some being nicer to your face but pulling their pants down once you turn around, and other's getting caught with their hands in the cookie jar, but there is no difference behind the curtains; there is no magic, just same suits working on the same con to exploit you. It's gambling with a mini-game attached, not vice versa.
In fact, best thing you can do for gaming atm, is play only single-player classics with no DLCs to pay for or completely lay off video games, cause they are in a very dark place atm, as far as consumers are concerned. Moneywise or industry-related, they are blooming like never before and putting movie industry to shame, exactly because people pre-order and ride hype trains just to realize all of it is introduction into gambling (only more polished than a real casino, with all the geriatrics or the elderly turned into T&A to distract you). It's nice for them to add some elderly character into the game, and some butch lesbian, and work on gender/age issues that suddenly became important; but when are we going to talk about much bigger issue of players-exploited, no matter the gender, and abusing psychology research a la Mengele to switch on addiction baits and turn players into chronic gamblers; or the fact that 2/3 of Pc owners can't enjoy most games with or without others… Expand"

Overwatch which I am still getting used to is a crazy fast game (maybe I'm just getting old) but I find myself gravitating towards the support classes so the young twitchy players can handle the front line offense.

The only reason I didn't rate Overwatch a 10 is because it seems to me that there aren't very many people playing it. I'm in Silicon Valley and I was pretty surprised when I found myself playing skirmish for almost 10 minutes before getting dropped into a game. When that game ended I was dumped back into skirmish because there were 'not enough players'. This was not in the early morning or very late night... it was evening on the west coast.

I will be playing a LOT more Overwatch. Great game.… Expand"

No, reviewing this game as a game leaves me feeling a bit offset. As a universe, Overwatch is amazing, simply mindblowing, and brings a bit of everything to the table, great characters, lores, fans, exc. As a game, well it's lackluster.

The game itself is a simple first person shooter with two teams of six. That's it. Each hero plays differently and counters another and so on, blah blah blah, we've all heard that before. Point is, as a game, it's repetitive and lacks any sort of story element. It also deals with a full price tag, for which it feels empty. Furthermore, you don't just GET the things you buy. Yes, you get the full game, but getting all the pieces of the game include more than your share of fully duplicate loot boxes, and the pure annoyance that comes from them.

This is not a solo game. You do not play this game for an engaging plot or interesting mechanics or deep lore and gameplay. No, you play this game with your friends. And that brings about the multiplayer issues with the game. Put simply, casual is full of trolls (but that's to be expected in any multiplayer game) and the brawls (special gamemodes that rotate in and out) feel unbalanced and underwhelming. So the only real way to play the game is competitively, and that is a mess. In the next season, they say they'll clear things up, but from the beta testers, Season 2 doesn't look any better than the first. The ranking system is messed up, skewed HARD in favor of those with dps skills and beefy computers. Healers get nothing, even though they are integral to winning a game. Ranked is bad. Very bad. Casual is only slightly better.

Long story short, Overwatch would be a 0 if not for the extra, out-of-game universe. If not for the cinematics and comics that keep me interested in the characters, I would not play the game. As it is, I only bought it to play with my friends... and I wouldn't keep playing if I had the choice. But after the hefty cost of entry, 40-60 bucks, I can't just put the game down. They promised me stuff, so I'll get stuff. I'll just enjoy the extra universe more.… Expand"

Its okayish in terms of a multiplayer online game but in the long run it has immeanse flaws.

One thing is the way hits and kills are counted in this game. Its not the evading player that is favored for, wel, evading, but the one shooting. that means, that if you are a tracer and blink around the corner you can die from a shot from a player with higher ping, that hit you on his screen. this is a well rounded mechanic for competitive matches in a closed network, but is the most **** up thing to ever be implemented in an ONLINE shooter.

another thing is the imbalance of heroes. the game is kept in balance by competitive and regular matches. this means there is a massive skill difference in the balancing itself. the hero bastion, the sitting turret of salt, is a strong pick and saltgrinder in normal games, but is so easily coutered in pro plays, that he is considered weak and is apt for a buff. the hero dva was considered relatively weak in the pro play and is now one of the best picks in a normal queue. this list goes on for a while.

Next nagging point: Matchmaking there is experience in this game. experience is gained by playing matches and, well, getting experience with the game. this means there is a big number that indicates a level of skill that this player is supposed to have attained. Now overwatch doesnt care at all. You WILL be matched with players much weaker than you or with players much much better than you for the sole purpose of creating relatively even win percentage, that enables blizzard to call their game ""balanced"".

Now the thing that made me so furious I decided to write a review about my experience with overwatch so far. Loot.
The loot - mechanic in this game is based on lootboxes handed out every level and always containing 4 items of varying rarity. these are white - common, blue - rare, pink - epic and orange - legendary. now white and blue is so common it doesnt even need to be divided at all and epic skins equal mildly rare items in every other game with loot. only legendary items are relatively rare. loot must not be obtained by luck alone but can also be bought for ingame curency, that is NOT buyable but has to be collected either as drop from boxes or from duplicates. additional to that there are skins that are exclusive to certain game editions or events. and these events are what caused me to see the **** that is the reward system in overwatch. Loot has been examined by reddit users and the largest quantity of loot listed there was a table of the experience of 30000 players. now they found that legendary loot spawns approximately every 14 boxes. now I had managed to obtain whole 4 legendary skins prior to lvl 35 and then started investing huge amounts of time in the summer event, to get exclusive skins, as i had already gotten 1. now I invested a whole day, not with sleep and eating, but whole 24 hours of my life to get more skins of the little above 4 legendaries for all 20+ characters. and when i hit lvl 53 at the end of the event i had an astounding 4 legendaries with 2 duplicates of said legendaries. of the 60 skins available I managed to pillage 4 and the game gave me 2 more of those i had already in possesion. now one might think they would be valuable, but they are not. Legenfdary skins cost 1000 currency (cur in short) and a legendary currency drop values at 500 cur. that means you have to get 2 legendary currency drops for a single legendary skin, but what value do legendary duplicates have? 200 cur! that is not even enough to buy an epic piece of loot. 5 legendary duplicates equal 1 skin in the shop, and the skin you might want to have cant possibly bought as it is an event skin you cannot get. you cant reroll these drops. you cant buy themwith money. you cant get them with time investment.

the game is, as i said, okayish, but its flaws weigh out its pros heavily. to screw up something like a reward system so hard, a system that has been done right in so many games, even in blizzard ones, is so sad to watch. i really wanted this game to make me have fun, but this single thing made me hate it so much.

I would like to see major improvements to the competitive system which right now isn't rewarding and just not very fun unless you're playing with a full team which isn't reasonable for most people. Leavers are rampant as the penalty for leaving is so lenient, so you will often lose competitive ranks simply because a random on your team rage quit. Another major problem with ranked is people are too clumped, all the ranks aren't being used fully so you can have two people of the same rank who are miles apart in skill level, this leads to frustration when you're put with teammates who are the same rank but clearly not of the same skill, it's amazing how many people at SR60 seemingly don't care about winning and would rather pick their favourite hero even if it's being hard countered.

The current hot topic is loot boxes, Blizzard originally stated all future cosmetic items would be available to be bought with currency, they have since gone back on this, updated their website and basically ignored the issue. Now we have limited edition boxes for the Summer games with unique items which are next to impossible to get without spending real life money, this has angered the community and rightly so, it's extremely scummy of Blizzard and it soured the entire event which otherwise was very enjoyable and this will clearly be their model going forward with future events, so expect to be disappointed every event when you don't get the skin you want because they won't allow you to spend your currency on it and you can't afford to drop £100 on RNG boxes (you can't simply buy what you want, you have to buy boxes and hope to get the item you want from 1000+ possibilities).

The game also suffers with a host of hit registration issues which causes endless amounts of frustration, if you've played Overwatch for even an hour you've been hooked through walls, been killed around corners and died after activating a life saving ability simply because what the server sees and what you see are two very different things and the server thinks you never even pressed the key.

If Blizzard can back off some of their greedy policies and fix competitive and the core gameplay issues then Overwatch could be amazing, if not it'll have a year or two and then fizzle out.… Expand"

A lot of the tanks have some kind of shield that can block damage. There are charactersMy experience with Overwatch has been a mess. The graphics of the game are bright and colorful instead of dark and gloomy like every shooter out there. Each of the characters has different abilities that they can use to their advantage in order to try to control whatever objective they are aiming after. A lot of the tanks have some kind of shield that can block damage. There are characters that specialize in tank slaying as well. The least played role is support though. There is a time limit to capturing the points, but it doesn't really matter since as long as someone stands on the point, it goes into overtime and overtime can extend indefinitely. The increased death timers do not really matter. If a match gets tied at the end, the game goes into sudden death where whoever captures the first objective instantly becomes the winner. I'd rather have the game just reward whoever did it faster with overtime counting against the team as well.

One of the best things about the game is its focus on objectives rather than just flat out kills. Individual players matter a lot less than a group that can play together. But here in lies the problem. Players are grouped together based on a Dynamic Queue and premade groups inherently have an advantage. While the game does try to pit premades against other premade groups, it doesn't always work out. You often get very one sided match ups, especially since they allow for a massive variance in skill in ranked. There was one game where I was playing with a rank 30 and a rank 60 pairing on the other team while I was in the high 40s. Needless to say, the rank 60 wiped out everyone and I still had to suffer a massive rank decrease for it.

My biggest complaint about the game is the lack of sense of progress. Your progress is measured by collecting experience from games. It takes 22000 experience to gain a level with most games netting you about 2000 experience. In about 11 to 12 games, you should gain a level and earn a loot box for 4 random items. The problem here is that duplicates are turned into very tiny amounts of currency, I'm talking like maybe 5. The cheapest items need around 25 while the most expensive cost 1000. There are some that you also cannot buy, such as the pre-order bonus Widowmaker and anything marked under ""events,"" like the Summer Olympics themed items.

When I heard this game was buy to play, I was hoping that it would be free of all the problems that came with free to play games, but I was wrong. This is a buy to play game with a cash shop and they do all of the things that free to play games do. They start with pretty bad servers. There are times when I randomly get disconnected for no apparent reason even though my Internet went down. There are times when Blizzard randomly decides to implement a patch with no warning, forcing everybody out of a game and having everyone take a loss. You can purchase loot boxes with real money to earn items faster and duplicates do get turned into currency.

The second complaint about the game is balance. I really have no idea what they were thinking when they did some of their patches. Soldier 76's and D. Va's shots were made to be highly unstable to the point where you literally have to be in their face to use it. McCree constantly moves between insanely broken and insanely useless. To top it off, too many characters have invincibility abilities. While invincibility might be nice for something like an ultimate, far too many people have it as a defensive ability, especially when they can still be targeted by allies for things like healing and they still are counted as contesting a point.… Expand"

However to simply call the game a first person shooter would be a disservice. Blizzard has crafted a game in this emergent genre of 'hero shooters/arena shooters; that borrows the best ideas from other games in the genre like Team Fortress 2. Blizzard has put their own spin on it to make it a fresh experience. The art style is fantastic too and is primed for a feature length film. It really is some gorgeous stuff and I don't think its an stretch to say that the visuals themselves would look at home in a Pixar film.

The performance is rock solid as well. The game has been incredibly well optimized and features one of the most robust suites of options I have seen in a PC game. This feels like it was built from the ground up for PC. You can customize damned near any key. You also can adjust key-bindings at the hero level. Yup, you have a set of key-bindings for each of the 21 heroes currently in the game. You can also customize the shape, and color of the on screen reticle. Its this attention to detail that shows in just about every area of the game.

Overwatch centers its focus on its heroes and how their abilities can be used with and against other heroes. Its focus on team composition and allowing you to swap heroes gives the game incredible depth and an underlying layer of player choice and strategy.

The game features a variety of modes such as training, practices vs. AI, as well as quick play. Within these modes the actual game types themselves can consist of things like payload (familiar to fans of TF2), capture point and King of the hill style matches. One of the criticisms leveled against the game is lack of content. I would agree with this statement if it was in regards to the number of modes themselves. But not every game needs a single player campaign. I feel that with the number of heroes on display here, a single player campaign would have diluted the multiplayer experience. Jeff Kaplan of Blizzard also pointed out that support heroes like Mercy would be tough to work into a single player campaign because of their nature as support heroes.

I would like to see more modes added over time. Perhaps Capture the flag. I don't think Team Death-match would fit well either. Blizzard has smartly decided to de-emphasize kills and kdr in favor of promoting team play. What is odd however is that the majority of the 'play of the game' are from people/heroes who rack up a lot of kills.

The game features a commendation system which on its own doesn't really mean much. But it can be nice to get commendations from your team mates if you do a good job of healing. It also has things like ""damage blocked."" It is a way of saying hey look how well you did your job, or performed your role.

The game features a progression system that gives you a loot box when you level up. These drops can be anything ranging from currency to skins, avatars, sprays, voice lines or victory poses. Its all superfluous but it is a nice way of customizing your character and making it your own. The game does have micro-transactions but these are only for loot boxes which are at the end of the day cosmetic stuff and don't impact the game itself. My initial concern is that the more games you play the higher the chance you will get duplicates from loot boxes. Fortunately those duplicates do reward you gold which can then be used towards something else you don't have.

In the end Overwatch is a fantastic well crafted game despite needing a few more modes. Blizzard have created a solid platform to build upon and have stated that future heroes and maps will be free which is very welcome indeed. Multiplayer only games can struggle to find success. Overwatch however has enough depth in its gameplay that it never felt repetitive.… Expand"

Overwatch is a place where you spend ~10 mins per round and shoot people and cast spells and make sure your team stood in the circle for the maximum amount of time. Longevity of the game for you is how long you can withstand doing just that. If you don't like fish, or tying knots, or are disgusted by mealworms... would you enjoy fishing? That is, if you don't like group-work, FPS games, MOBAs, cartoons, then you will not enjoy overwatch. Period.… Expand"

If, however, you crave white-knuckle, skill-based shooter action, you will come away disappointed.

There is very little scope for individual ability to shine - the game is entirely team based, resulting in a dull experience where nobody is really any better than anybody else. Combat is dominated by the Q button, which releases ludicrously easy, mega powered specials. The guns themselves are incredibly weak otherwise, resulting in combat that is slow and uneventful. If you shoot somebody, their healer heals them, resulting in a lengthy, tedious stalemate until somebody busts out their Q-button special and kills everything without any skill or aim at all.

It's ironic that in a game where the characters are described as ""Heroes"", that there is no possibility of individual heroism at all. Teams clump up like sheep and heal each other. This is no game for heroes, this is a game that rewards the herd mentality. Unlike any respectable shooter, it is virtually impossible to take on superior numbers and win because the skill ceiling is so low. No, heroes need not apply in Overwatch.

Map design is very questionable with some nigh on impenetrable choke points, an issue further exacerbated by the presence of some extremely campy characters, resulting in static rather than dynamic gameplay and a crushing sense of the inevitable since, once again, we can't call upon superior skill to help us overcome the odds since there is no skill in overwatch.

Overall, Overwatch = Underwhelming. Mildly fun in small doses, but shooter fans will come away feeling very lukewarm.… Expand"

~ Limited game modes
>> So far there are no original game modes, only Payload, Capture the Point and King of the Hill. They are enjoyable but Blizzard can and should do more.

- Community
>> It's bad.

1) Language. Maybe not as bad as DotA / LoL / CS, I haven't played those games so I can't comment, but ""ez"" ""rekt"" and stuff along those lines is a common occurrence.

2) Team composition. It's clearly important in a game where each class counters and is countered by others, more or less harshly. Support classes (read: healers) are generally not picked, and a team without a healer generally performs badly. It's so bad that most of the times I feel pretty much forced to pick either role if I don't want to get stomped... as a result, my first and third most played classes are a healer and a tank.

Also, class stacking (especially snipers... *cough* hanzo *cough*) is an issue, as less diversity is typically bad.
I just had a game where most of my team were snipers. In attack. 3 hanzos, 1 widow, me (tank) and another guy (not healer of course). Yes, we failed hard.

Now that competitive mode is out, people feel even more justified to fuc* around in quickplay because ""lol tryhard is just quickplay!!11"".

On the other hand I understand that people might want to practice characters that they never get the chance to play, but that's Blizzard's fault for not implementing a TDM game mode.

- Netcode
>> I was happy with it at first, then I started noticing all the little issues that slowly pile up and make you realise that something is very wrong with the game. It uses a client based hit detection, but the client's tickrate is a mere 20hz (compared to 60hz of most online shooters). Also, awful hitboxes for projectile weapons make the whole thing much worse: the most notorious is Hanzo, who is able to shoot people behind cover due to the massive size of its arrows' hitbox. Also, headshots are very frequent and they always seem off in the killcam.

- Balance
>> Some classes are / have been very badly balanced.
The most glaring example was Widowmaker, able to shave off 3/4 of most classes HPs and kill a Zenyatta with a BODYSHOT. Instakilling a class with a bodyshot from a semiautomatic sniper rifle with no sway, no bullet drop, huge magazine and little recoil is insane, I wonder how that made it past QA.

- Matchmaking
>> I was very, very disappointed. In short:
1) Most of my games are stomps. Stomps are never fun for me, even when winning. Close, enjoyable games are 20-30%.
2) a LOT of premades. Joining as a solo player is a frustrating experience. The game tries to match groups with groups, but more often than not the result is quite imbalanced. Being in an organised group allows you to sync ultimates, that makes a HUGE difference against solos. The most irritating things are that you can't know who's in a premade (in quickplay), and the fact that even competitive does NOT have a dedicated solo queue.

Also, make sure you join with strong friends. I tried joining with some friends who are not really good at these games (one never played FPS...), the matchmaker tries to match you against other groups that are often very organized, so it ends up being WORSE than solo queue.

3) Leavers not being punished enough. You can leave a game and avoid a loss in your statistics.
The poor sod who fills the spot, instead, will get the loss (if the team loses of course, which is likely at that point).
This can happen even in the last second of a match. That happens to me around 15-25% of the times I start a match.

That means you join, see the counter at 1 second, get a loss and you're booted out. Excessive leaving will trigger a temporary penalty in exp (-75%), but that simply means less levels = less lootboxes = less skins. Not a big deal.

Even worse, leaving in competitive causes massive skill level gains reductions for EVERYONE, even the other team.

- Bull$hit ultimates
>> This is entirely personal, but I HATE ultimates that pretty much simulate cheats - I'm talking about Widowmaker's wallhack and Soldier's aimbot. Lame, lame, lame.

Conclusion:
A great FPS with a very solid foundation, unfortunately plagued by many (not unfixable!) issues that ruin the whole experience.… Expand"

Team Fortress 2 currently has death match, team death match, king of the hill, capture the flag, and escort the payload. Overwatch has king of the hill and escort the payload. That's IT. There are lots of other things TF2 just does a lot better as well.

I think another big problem is that Overwatch's unlockables system is horrible. TF2 brought unlockables to the game WHEN it became free to play. With overwatch you pay $60 dollars and yet they STILL managed to sneak in micro transactions. Want as skin? Well, you could wait to earn it with in game currency, but as usual this takes ages. Or, you can pay real world money for it.

The matchmaking is crap, too. Kinda like a MOBA, one bad player makes the whole team crumple BADLY. The process feels like playing World of Warcraft battlegrounds/arenas with a pick up group...and I didn't want to pay $60 for that experience.

Finding a match is easy and quick usually. The characters designs are interesting and their powers are impactful and fun. Why is this game not a 10/10 like some of the critic reviews, you may be asking yourself.

Overwatch has several shortcomings (knowing Blizzard these will be fixed in time) that hold it back from a full recommendation to all gamers. For one this game is only a multiplayer online shooter, so you are subject to other people's success and failure as much as your own and that can be frustrating at times, especially considering the amount of teamwork required. One guy who refuses to change classes to help the team can lose you the game. If no one wants to play tank or healer, well, good luck winning. Also, there a decent amount of maps, but the game could certainly use more.

If you're not the type of FPS fan that likes to like of things like strategy and meta, than this may not appeal to you. If you're very competitive, this may not appeal to you, as you can only control 1/6 of the outcome of the game, unless you make a team with your friends. Finally if you want a story mode or something novel other than standard multiplayer matches you can find elsewhere you may be disappointed.

People that love online competitive TEAM shooters, will love this game, but many people will get bored quickly as there isn't a whole lot of modes (yet) or things you haven't seen before.

To all the critics yelling about class balancing, they just don't know how to play the game.  Every class has an answer.  The people complaining about imbalances probably have not explored each character to their full potential.  It is an extremely well balanced and fair game.

Plus, it's just fun.  Admittedly waaaay more fun if you have a group you can communicate with.  The in-game VOIP sounds very clear, but rarely do you get a pub group where more than one or two people actually talk.  I typically play in discord with a full team of 6, which is always satisfying.

See that new character trailer for Ana? It's the medic from Killing Floor, but 7 years later. It is all these things but less, and yet it is rated equally or higher than any of them.

The art assets are stunning, fluid, and surprisingly consistent in their styling. The game runs practically without a hitch. And yet it is dull, uninspiring, unoriginal, and hardly fun.

Weapon reloads break up action for no reason. Respawn times break up action for no reason. Every game mode is a variation of capture and hold with minimal variation in the back end. Character classes are almost exclusively lifted from prior team shooters. Off the top off my head (straight from memory, no checking):

Tracer is the scout from TF
Widowmaker is the sniper from TF
Hanzo might as well be the same
Pharah is the soldier from TF or a soldier with a spinfusor from Tribes
Junkrat is the demoman from TF
Mercy is the medic from TF 2
Zarya is the heavy weapons guy from TF and TF 2
Torbjorn is the engineer from TF
Reaper is the spy from TF (2 specifically)
McCree's special honor is having the spy's pistol
Roadhog is the smoker from Left 4 Dead
Every support character's powers are lifted verbatim from City of Heroes - Lucio is a sound defender, Symmetra is an energy/force field defender, Mercy is an empath or the medic as mentioned, and Zenyatta is roughly a dark defender
Winston is essentially the tank from Left 4 Dead but with a gun
Soldier 76 is Visor from Quake 3 Arena
D. Va is the mech from Gloom
Reinhardt is also a tank from Left 4 Dead, but with defense powers of the assault from Global Agenda
Bastion is also more or less the HWGuy from TF in his application
Ana is the medic from Killing Floor
Mei is an ice controller from City of Heroes

Who else is left? Genji, who is Grey Fox but worse. The designs are pretty good-looking and again, stylistically consistent which is rarely achieved. But we've seen all of this before, or at least I thought we had.

Escort game mode is ripped straight from TF 2, which ripped it from Wolfenstein: ET (Gold Rush for example).

Assault is as old as objective-based maps from Unreal Tournament (1999) or Counter-Strike but without objectives.

Hybrid is a half-hearted attempt at solving that problem.

Control dates all the way back to ""Canal Zone"" in TF, but its application was heartily used in practically every game since from all of the Battlefields to Global Agenda.

Most female characters have identical faces; literally half the skins are palette swaps.

Many unique features of previous team shooters were left on the floor for no apparent reason: single player campaigns, objective-based missions, elimination, free-for-all modes, CTF and Threewave - more than 2 teams at once for that matter, power-ups, escort-the-VIP, vehicles, story-based multiplayer campaigns, dedicated server listings, co-op modes, fortifications beyond just turrets and mines, freerunning, loadout customization, pets, modding... Again, all straight from memory.

Overwatch is an utterly banal, unoriginal game that is light on content. It does nothing new at all: in fact, even the UI work is mostly borrowed conceptually from decades-old games like Halo 2. It uses no new or groundbreaking rendering methods. It does not make any developments in networking or technology period.

94,cucochukoluko,"Jul 11, 2016",0,"Overwatch is essentially a Early Access, which costs neither more nor less than $40 for PC and $60 for consoles. Blizzard is a genius company, they are the best when it comes to disguising! You are paying that money for a Quick match, and promises, a lot of promises. You PAID $40 for a ranked system which WAS gonna be great, blah blah. Look at it now that it has launched, it's **** but IOverwatch is essentially a Early Access, which costs neither more nor less than $40 for PC and $60 for consoles. Blizzard is a genius company, they are the best when it comes to disguising! You are paying that money for a Quick match, and promises, a lot of promises. You PAID $40 for a ranked system which WAS gonna be great, blah blah. Look at it now that it has launched, it's **** but I won't go into that, investigate it yourself. That happens when one pays for promises, it's like buying a car without doors, but hey the promise you they will give these to you in 4 months. Great. Just great. AND NOT ONLY THAT, the game itself is a copy of TEAM FORTRESS 2. Yeah guys, the CORE is the same, but of course, it has a lot of improvements and a different gameplay vision (each character has its own abilities, etc...). So, paying $40 or $60 for that? Nope. If you ask me to review this game in an independent  way.. Well, it's solid, definitly not a 1. But it's not a **** F2P. You have to pay a lot, and the game has microtransactions, the worst kind of microtransactions, which is trending now in the industry. You like a skin huh, ok, you have to buy a box which contains random loot, so it's about luck to get your skin. Yep, you can't purchase it straight forward like in League of Legend for example. You have to buy a whole lot of boxes to get your skin. This is what I call random microtransaction.  So, overall: it's fun, but have a ****ed up competitive mode, it's still in Early Access metaphorically speaking, and it's priced like a AAA video game. **** you Blizzard and your awful politics. Since Activision bought Blizzard, they had died.… Expand"

97,Freelance7,"Jul 11, 2016",10,"Before I started playing Overwatch, my outlook on Multiplayer was...ehh. But then I tried out the beta and I just fell in love with multiplayer over again. It's like Team Fortress 2, with different sections for character, yet it's more fast paced and isn't based on kills. It's a game that encourages teamplay, and the best way to play it is with friends.

I also liked the art style. It's friendly, pretty, and very Pixar-like.

But the best part are the characters. Some have VERY small balancing issues, but they are all well balanced and each character has their counters. Not only that, but no one character does the same thing, each one does unique stuff. Tracer can dash around and rewind time while blasting enemies with her pistols, Widowmaker snipes and is able to tell the team of enemy locations, D.va uses a mech to be the aggressor, blasting her way through enemies, and Zenyatta is able to turn enemies to butter with his discord orb. And what I really give a lot of credit to Blizzard for is how alive the characters are. Each have a personality that makes them as unique as their abilities. Personally, my favorite is Tracer.

So, should you buy it? I mean, I thought it was worth it, and I have a lot of fun with my friends. But it's not a game meant for everybody. Each match can be 5 - 15 minutes long, meaning if you ever have a bit of time, you can play a single match before doing what needs to be done.

Just don't get the Origins Edition unless you REALLY want those skins. I got the regular edition for 40 dollars, and it was worth every penny. If you love multiplayer, or want to try and get back into multiplayer, then Overwatch is the game for you.… Expand"
98,Drak71,"Jul 10, 2016",6,"Nice to look at, but terrible balance, maps and matchmaking make this game more frustrating than enjoyable.   Other than skins, there is no reason to continue to level in this game, and the limited selection of maps becomes tedious quickly. There are other fps that are more worthy of your money."

I realize i only spent a small fraction of that time having actual fun. I mean, I can win a game thats a complete 1 sided stomp in the favor of my team. but is that really all that fun?

I'm sure this game is a lot more fun for people who can consistently have 5 friends online who all are in discord or skype coordinating and making it happen together as a team. But for anyone trying to go at it solo, you are at the mercy of a horrible MM system to decide whether or not you're worthy of a game that either doesn't end in a complete one sided stomp.… Expand"
