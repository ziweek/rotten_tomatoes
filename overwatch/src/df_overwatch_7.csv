This is just another MOBA game , just on a FPS engine and POV. And the core of the gameplay isn't masterful shooting or dodging or jumping, no, it's rock-paper-scissors with picking the correct composition of hero characters. Well, I say you have a wide variety of Facebook games for rock-paper-scissors. And with such amount of content this game does not deserve to have a price higher than, let's say, Doom. Gave it 4 bars of 10, because that's how I value games: 4 bars for the visuals/audio/comforts, and 6 bars for the gameplay. Graphically it's 4/4, gameplay-wise it's 0/6 for me.… Expand"

-  The gameplay is short enough so if you are faced with a team of cheaters, then it will be over quickly unlikes CS GO I am stuck with a cheater for a full hour.
- It encourages teamplay over lonewolf type of style. It feels so rewarding when you execute a strategy as a team. And there are a lot of heros that allow all sort of cheesey strats.

Cons:
- Micro transaction system makes level progression extremely slow, as they encouraging you to buy the crates instead of grinding out the EXP for skins and customization.
- There are simply not enough content to justify the price tag, comparing to other big titles out there. You pretty much get 3 gamemode and that's about it. I wish they would implement the Arcade matchmaking like in StarCraft 2.
- It's too much rock, paper, and scissor. You cannot really main a particular hero, so it is hard to grow emotional attachment to one of them, especially where you can customize their appearance. You're required to switch out heros that counter the other team's hero in order to win objectives.
- Heroes like genji has very high skill ceiling and it feels outright broken when it is used by a very very good player. It can feel broken at times, and there are no characters that would shut him down hard. .
-  You would still need a very good FPS skill to perform well.  Aiming is very important part of Overwatch to win the games, but not as important as CS GO. Characters that require little aiming can easily be countered by a player with superior aiming.
-   The teamwork in this game is very involved so you will need a premade team of 6 people to play the game. Solo queing often leads to frustration, as you sometimes get a troll or a rager in your team and it can get very toxic.
-  Due to the team based nature of the game, most games I play is either one team steamrolling another, and vice versa. It makes this game very boring. Matchmaking is based on how well each individual perform in a game but the match itself relies on how well the team cooperate rather than individual performace.
-  Individual performance is not as meaningful like other games. Sometimes you felt like you did so well, but there are simply no meaningful recognition. It's important to be recognized for your hard work, especially when soloqueiing. This has result in most games I play everybody only wants to do a successive elimination so that they can get on the highlight ""Play of the Game"" after round ends. Going for the objective becomes secondary.… Expand"

I'd honestly just say to stick to Team Fortress 2, at least for now. It has far more content, game modes, support, and customization, and it's free. Overwatch is prettier and has a wider variation of characters, but in the end the game's structure seems to struggle with itself far too much. It sets itself up to be a big, interesting universe with interesting characters and events, but then all it does is throw those characters in a pit and make them duke it out. Hopefully in the future Blizzard will add some more substance to this game, but as of right now, it feels pitifully average.… Expand"

The atmosphere is beyond amazing and it is an amazing first person shooter set to fit the needs of many different types of gamers. Some of the lore doesn't make sense but the game isn't meant to focus on lore. It requires teamwork and a proper selection and combination of heroes.

It's technically correct that the heroes are all varied and balanced, but the way Blizzard has balanced them has been to make them all have fairly glaring weaknesses that need support.

There are other games that are perfectly balanced where you still feel like you can make a big difference in a game, but in OW if the teammate you need to support you fails you're going to fail too without question. Players are essentially cogs in Blizzard's team synergy machine (but they're such well balanced cogs!).

I think a great point of comparison is Evolve, which many critics said was too simplistic. OW is by any measure more simplistic than Evolve, except to maintain fake balance your abilities don't do anything compared to what they would in Evolve. If you don't do something about the Shield Beam in Evolve, the monster will lose without question, and when the Support goes down if the monster can't keep him from getting revived that can be game over. In contrast, Zarya in OW has a shield that lasts like 2 seconds. Big **** deal. Reinhardt's shield can be broken by Bastion in like 3 seconds - but it's never just Bastion, is it?

It's a nice shooter from Blizzard, not to serious, not to cheesy. For me, person who hates military shooters this title suits well. The game is very fast paced and there is always some action going on, which is great.
Pros:
- Pretty good and consistent artstyle
- Cool heroes with distinct abilities
- Fluid and polished combat
- Simple to pick up, but has enough depth to not get bored quickly
- Great performance even on older machines
- Engaging gameplay centered on objectives.

Pros:
- Game suffers from not that good netcode with only ~20Hz tickrate
- No ranked (competitive mode) on release (being reworked and patched in at a later date)
- Hero stacking can be frustrating at times

One more thing is that people complain about it's business model. Personally I like buy to play model, with some cosmetic micro-transaction. If this had pay-walls or grind-walls with f2p model, I would not even play it. I hate that in hearthstone and hate that in Heroes of the Storm. With Overwatch, you can take few months break and don't fall behind compared to other people - all heroes (including upcoming ones) are available right of the bat, same goes for maps and game modes and what not - basically all content, apart cosmetics (which is not any in-game advantage whatsoever).

But this is fun game, especially to play with friends (but it's okay too when playing with random people). If you look for hardcore competitive game with advanced mechanics and lot of depth - this games is probably not for you, in other case - I can recommend it.

UPDATE!!! (mostly about competitive mode)

I initially gave it weak 8/10. But since Blizzard patched in competitive mode (aka ranked system) I've decided to update my review.

Basically competitive mode is in broken state. There are serious bugs (or maybe design choice) related to how your rank progression is calculated. As notable example, if you win the competitive game, and there is a leaver (person who abandoned game), regardless if you are on affected team or not, in any winner gets barely no rank progress (in comparison on average it's more than 50% of rank progress, with a leaver it's less than 10%), but you always lose full amount of progress regardless if some leaver screws your game. 1week in, still no response on this issue. Additionally, people with 60% or greater winrate can fall in ranks just like that.

Matchmaking is terrible, especially for solo people and small party groups. Most games are either you stomp the enemy or you are being stomped. Close games are scarce.

The competitive mode is plagued with leavers (which can basically can leave as they please, because you have to abuse it to get even slightest penalty), griefers (who basically play the game their own way ignoring team's interest), trolls and all kind of people that will ruin you the fun of competing with other players.

On top of that if game ends in draw, you basically play a coin flip, because draw is played on asymmetric map, where one side gets attack and other defense (that is not 50/50 chance to win).

It's not a super competitive game when you go heavy try-hard mode, but competitive mode is competitive, even with casual aspects, but in current iteration it's absolutely broken and it will cause you only frustration due to multiple bugs and/or design flaws. Because the only long-term value is competitive mode (which should give you progression system and goals to achieve) and it's broken I'm changing my verdict from 8 to 5/10. Even if you look at this game more casually and intend to play just like 1-2 weeks per season, still some things can't be ignored and I eventually would not recommend it at this point.… Expand"

Sticking with Blizzard games since Diablo 2, Stracraft, and Warcraft 3 I've grown impressed. WoW was something that did suck the soul out of my life for years. Now for me lately a majority of their games have not been hitting desirable marks. Pretty much every expansion after WotLK was a disappointment and Diablo 3 just didn't live up to expectations. I keep telling myself ""they'll do something their player base will like, they care about their players..."" when in truth it doesn't seem like they really care about their players, even after they get kicked in the nuts like they did with the WoD expansion. I played a lot of HotS but overall i feel satisfied with the experience, too. This game is already acknowledged for it's toxic community, I feel like they had a missed opportunity with the cards after match where instead maybe they could elect people who had some beneficial effect for their team, such as a selfless character swap to help the team out. Also, the inclusion of taunts feel pointless if it's going to last for about 3 seconds and I die almost immediately when using it.

Now that was about the report card I gave blizzard, now to get to Overwatch. Also KEEP IN MIND this game has been in development for a while. All because they cancelled Titan doesn't mean they IMMEDIATELY went to the press to say they'd work on OW instead.

The good:

Pixxaresque animation

Characters with personality and backstory

Music

The bad:

Inconsistent hit boxes(such as roadhog hooks that hook people around corners)

I'm not sure if this is the same as above but there may be a delay in game or inconsistent animation timers such as Zarya's bubble

the game's balancing issues around snipers damage, mei, reaper, tracer, genji, zarya(maybe her shield buff duration is just a glitch) mercy ult, and

since the game is more about heroes working together it seems questionable that they allow multiple of the same heroes. this concept is also rather game breaking as the double reinhardt, 3 bastion, and lucio set up. because of things like this some defenses are impenetrable due to poor balance.

Stuck in a time vortex! Injected with Captain America drugs! You will facepalm every time. Every. Single. Time. (These aren't spoilers, they exist in the lore outside of the game.) Being an ethical person who cares about equal representation rights, I'd ask where the objectified men and older women are. They're not there. There are lots of games out there with a much more genuinely diverse cast of characters, and without all of this skeevy sexism intended to result in porn.

Did you know that major porn sites had to block 'Overwatch' searches and uploads because it was getting out of hand? It was all over the gaming news because it pretty much exemplifies what Overwatch is about. It's a skeevy porn game. And the game is designed to be as comforting and as easy as possible to reach as many perverts as possible.

It's overly easy, slow paced, and nothing about it requires any skill whatsoever. It's basically what would happen if Candy Crush Saga and Team Fortress 2 had a kid, and then that kid was raised by a skeevy uncle with regressive views about women. That's exactly what it is. And with the tiny amount of content present and how lazily designed it all is, it just felt like a rip off to me.

There are just better experiences out there. Games more deserving of your money.… Expand"

The inability to actually choose what maps to play on (and even game modes! You aren't allowed to select a game mode) is a very weird design decision. I don't think I've ever played a game before where you can't choose a game mode, but instead have one forced upon you.

Many heroes are badly balanced due to Blizzard's choice to always favor the shooter, regardless of latency (and to make matters worse, Blizzard - for whatever reason - have chosen to implement notably poor tick rates in their servers). This means you will often times be killed behind cover or targeted by abilities that shouldn't be able to go through walls. A prime example of this is Roadhog's hooking ability, which will drag you through walls to the opponent who then instantly kills you. This happens more often than not, and is extremely frustrating to experience.

For a game that is seemingly designed to be F2P but with a full price tag, it is alarmingly lacking in content.

Would I recommend Overwatch? It depends... If you're a solo online player, I wouldn't be bothered by it. But if you can stomach the issues it suffers from and have some mates to play with, it might be worth a shot.… Expand"

I scored a 0 because I have enjoyed many FPS games dating back to DOOM2.
Pros:
Rich lore and backstory to all the characters
Fun ability mechanics
Good interplay between characters

Cons:
AI Matchmaking is stupid for FPS games.  I can't just play with friends or hang out.  Blizzard has decided it knows more about how I should enjoy my game experience than I do and gives me no ability to say otherwise.
Mechanics are a straight clone of TF2--not a bad thing, but TF2 isn't $60.
No viable bot AI at all.  This means that there is no viable forum for practicing and getting better at the game.
Map design is a bit awkward.  Choke points are present
No game mode variety.  Most people play payload and capture point anyways, but sometimes deathmatch or arena add a lot of variety to an otherwise stale feeling game.
Plays like a MOBA from first person view.  Locked abilities, no powerups, ultimate ability cooldowns.  This is basically World of Warcraft PvP arenas in an FPS interface.  I can't find new guns--there are no real points of interest on the map.  I don't even have to worry about ammo.
There's no modding.  Want to make your own maps?  Blizzard's response is, ""like what we give you.""
No story telling.  You can read some of the story and pick up bits and pieces.  Blizzard clearly invested a lot of time into this new IP, but failed to deliver any of it in a fun or interesting manner (maybe youtube videos count?  but that's not part of the game you buy. . .)

Long and short of it, this game is the most atrocious cash grab since CoD 6.  It contributes nothing to the FPS genre and actually takes us back more than 25 years in overall gameplay quality.  Blizzard tried to make a game about interesting characters but missed the basic premise of a first-person game:  THE PLAYER IS THE CHARACTER!  First person games are supposed to be about choices and consequences and they jail their players into liking their interpretation of the first person genre, and then try to cover up their lack of basic understanding of the genre by paying off reviewers.  I expected so much better from Blizzard--but this really is their first attempt at making a FPS games and their lack of experience is painfully obvious.  If this was a 3rd person multiplayer action game, it might feel different and be more enjoyable, but at this point that's just an awful way to save face on an otherwise poorly executed game.… Expand"

Y otro punto es de que el juego es puro OLINE y tiene los mismos modos de juego como captura la bandera, captura el punto de control, y la que mas me llamo la atención fue la de Carga explosiva como se dice en TF2 (que consiste de llevar por unas vías de tren un un carreta una bomba y llevarla su destino) pero a qui en ves de ser una bomba es una limusina blindada, la verdad es los mismos  TF2 sin excepción solo con mujeres muy sexualizadas y el publico no ve las criticas reales que son las de los jugadores a mi en lo personal no me interesa una critica de un critico de Ahora por razones de corrupción, lo malo que el juego esta incompleto solo ONLINE en serio a pero eso si puedes comprar skins que para mi es como si el juego lo hubieran echo hace 6 meses no loan terminado por falta de dinero y como se lo gastaron mas en propaganda de todo tipo si hasta contenido para adultos por que esos artistas no cobran barato y debió ser un buen trato, pero volviendo al tema del Gaming es igualito al TF2 y el TF2 es gratis y la comunidad genial pero esto que esto no es un juego real esto es un juego reciclado y pagar como 999.00 pesos mexicanos no lo vale y creo que sera de esos juegos como TF2 que antes fue de paga y después Gratis y como deje antes ami se me hace un juego incompleto y que aparte sera terminada después de recaudar dinero con los skins .

Personajes:
Los personajes de OW para mi y en verdad 2 o mas hacen a uno del TF2 como un ejemplo: WindoWmaker+Hanzo=Sniper del TF2 pero por que miren para los que no han jugado TF2 el sniper tiene varias arnas pero se dividen en 2 Sniper y arco y tiene la misma jugabilidad hasta las dos armas de Window que son el sniper y rifle de asalto eso los tiene el mismos Sniper pero del TFClassic y así con todos Tracer+Lúcio=Scout, Spy=Genji+Reaper+McCree(El spy tambien depende de los disparos ala cabeza), Ingeniero=Torbjörn+Symmetra, este he visto en el juego de OW 4 Heavy=Roadhog+BASTION+WINSTON+Zarya, Medic=MERCY+Zenyatta, Pyro=Mei, Saldado=Soldado: 76+Pharah,  y al final mi perosnaje favorito del TF2 que es DEMOMAN que se comforma 2 uno repetido que son: Demoman:REINHARDT+PHARAH(de nuevo)+JUNKRAT ere fianl es el mas copiado por si lanza bombas lapa y su famoso sticky jump, mismas mecánicas en todos los personajes y por favor antes de critica mal o bien un juego comparen los 2 tanto como OW y el TF2 que tiene suerte de ser gratis y no pierden nada

Motivos por que su éxito:
1.- Mucha publicidad de cual quier tipo sin perdonar.
2.- Gaming reciclado de un FPS real que es el TF2 que lleva mas de 9 años apenas en este año.
3.-Personajes femeninos muy sexualizadas tanto como en FanArt como en el Juego.
4.-Mucha prensa Corrupta.
5.-Una jugabilidad muy fácil como en PC y en consolas que la verdad lo puede jugar un niño que juega COD o Splatoon sin tanta experiencia.
6.-El juego esta dirigido al publico masculino de 12 a 25 años.
7.-Texturas muy infantiles y no tiene Gore.
8.-Y personas que compran jugos pro moda.

The rock paper scissor balancing is the biggest nuisance in the game, but that is to be expected from Blizzard who are known for atrocious player vs player experiences.

The game runs on 20 ticks servers, which is something that should be a thing of the past, basically it is like playing BF2 all over again. You will get shot through walls and behind cover constantly. If you have ever played an FPS before, you will get annoyed with this game almost instantly once you realize that there is no difference between people who are absolutely garbage and people who know what they are doing.

Some of the ultimates are literal aimbots, meaning that even if you're the worst player with parkinsons and brittle bone disease you will get easy kills. The skill ceiling of this game is reached within the first few matches. The only competitive thing being the pre-match sitting-around-in-spawn arguing with people trying to make a coherrent team. Not that it matters, as one button ultimates will demolish good or bad alike.

I've played CS 1.6, CS:GO and BF2-4 on a very high level and I can without the shadow of a doubt say that this is the worst FPS game I have ever seen. There's no recoil, you don't need to aim as the hitboxes and abilities will do all the work for you, the servers are atrocious 20tick compared to 128 in games like CS, the graphics look like TF2 but use resources like it's the Witcher with hair physics on with useless garbage cluttering the screen at any given time, maps are boring and horribly made with chokepoints.

The custom game option is probably the only enjoyable thing about it to play with friends, as you can change the recharge and spawntimes of abilities, but even that gets old quickly due to the lack of content and the AI being absolutely garbage and it only being able to use about a 4th of the heroes in the game.

It's overpriced, overhyped and a terrible FPS game. People will tell you that you're ""hating on it because it's popular"" but these people have no reference as to what a competitive game should offer.

TL;DR

**** maps, terrible balancing, boring visuals, no progression, no learning or improving one self except for map layout, atrocious matchmaking, terrible voice acting, dumb abilities and ****ty attitudes.

I've never liked multiplayer in Blizzard games. And Overwatch is no exception. People like to say that Overwatch is the “new” or will “replace” TeamOverwatch is a fundamentally flawed team shooter with uninspired character design, laughable balance, and over seven million players who once again assumed that just because Blizzard made a game, it must therefore automatically be good. I've never liked multiplayer in Blizzard games. And Overwatch is no exception. People like to say that Overwatch is the “new” or will “replace” Team Fortress 2. This is completely untrue for a number of reasons. Really, this game should be compared to the equally poorly-designed Dirty Bomb. They share a colorful aesthetic and a quasi-militaristic character design, but also, and this is Overwatch's fatal flaw, an unbelievably awful damage model. The balance issues have been called out by the playerbase, and there do seem to be efforts made in that regard. But that ignores the deeper issue: Overwatch is, at its core, not fun to play, for the same reason most “modern” shooters are.
Let me refer here to a game I refer to often, and will continue to refer to, an icon of the golden age of PC Gaming: Unreal Tournament, better known today as UT99, after the year of its release. Among the first entirely multiplayer-focused FPSs, Unreal Tournament required players to hone not only their ability to draw an initial bead on a target, but also their team coordination, knowledge of the map, locations of weapon and item spawns, and, ultimately, their ability to maintain your aim on a target and sustain an engagement until your opponent was dead, which in some cases could last for several continuous seconds. Can you even imagine? A gunfight in a team shooter that lasts longer then it takes to hit the like button on a picture of Tracer's ass?

Overwatch has no “sustained engagements.” What it has, like what Dirty Bomb has, what Call of Duty has, what Planetside 2 has, what nearly every “modern” shooter has, is a glorified game of rock, paper, scissors, or perhaps a cell phone “clicking” game. The two teams crash together,  whoever picked the right weapon, or in this case, characters and mashed their ability buttons fast enough bowls over the other team, leaving them scrambling to group together and try to reengage successfully. It even manages to build on the “blink and your dead” gameplay by providing its characters with, in many cases, instant-kill abilities that, unlike Call of Duty, they don't even have to “earn” by “killstreaks”, they simply recharge on their own, over time. You won't believe how much time you can spend dead in a game with a 5 second respawn timer. Because it's a hell of a lot.

It's surprising considering they've never made an FPS before, but Blizzard has created one so dependent on mere reaction time that you'll scarcely believe that every player but you isn't hacking. They've pushed the “modern” shooter to the pinnacle of its horrific genetic degradation,  successfully dumbing down FPS gameplay into a mathematical equation with only one acceptable answer. No time to look for health pickups or run to your healer. No time to turn around and counter-fire. No time to look for an alternate route to try and flank. No time for anything. If you do the slightest thing wrong, you're not only dead, you probably just cost your team the win.

Sure, you could try some medium bot games to cool off, but they're some of the dumbest bots around and while they might be good for a laugh, they certainly won't give you good practice. Or you could play on hard bots and watch them mob up flawlessly and play murderball with your team and your mood. Or you could play some custom games with your friends and not earn any XP towards the game's paltry rewards.

Overwatch attracts a certain subset of players that have no shortage of hate, especially where Battleborn is concerned. As someone with not only a lot of vitriol to dispense about multiplayer games but also the capacity to be aware of that fact, and as someone who is generally unpleasant when salty, I generally try to avoid games l  like this one. I bought it only because it seems to be the “in thing” with people I know and I'd rather be sociable then not. But really, the game just makes me sad, not only because it's a sorry excuse for an FPS, but because the vast majority of people seem to be blissfully unaware of that fact. I'm not saying I'm smarter then them or even a better player. I just think they've been lied to. I don't think any less of people for playing the games they want to play, because I do that every day of my life. But I can and will think less of people who willfully put down the games that I like because they're not Overwatch, or something equally formulaic. I give it a 1 here because it at least didn't crash.

I am damn glad that I have alternatives. I urge everyone here to go give Unreal Tournament 4 a try- It's free, after all.… Expand"

Some heroes have literal aim assist to help them (you can watch ""arrows"" curve towards their target. Numerous characters barely even have to aim. The game is ""accessible.""  In addition to that, 4 (yes... 4) heroes have the ability to completely deny damage (as in remove it entirely), and all of the abilities to do so are on a ~6 second cooldown. That's absolutely ludicrous design for an FPS, it punishes good aim!

Map design is bad... Many maps have small choke points some with only a single entrance, all of them are easily locked down, this turns the game into a meatgrinder until either the attacking side manages to eventually break through or the game ends (TONS OF FUN!)

Matchmaking is forced 50-50. You can cheese the system by leaving games you're losing but despite being an incredible player, your W/L will tend to 50/50 regardless unless you're in an organized team, this is because it tries to even you out by putting you against far better teams if you're above 50-50.

Dev response time is slow, this is Blizzard we are talking about...

There seems a lack of consistency here, and the power of attacks isn't telegraphed (you'll have to learn all of this by playing many hours).
2. The game doesn't communicate to you which weapons are hitscan and which are projectiles. Furthermore, the projectiles and hit boxes are much larger than they appear. It can be confusing for new players who don't understand the hitbox sizes.
3. There's little incentive to master more than a couple of characters. they are all very different and you'll find that playing a character you aren't good at can make your team lose the match.
4. Lack of competitive mode. It's a shame the game didn't launch with competitive. It's hugely important and will possibly effect the score of the game.

The positives:
1. Good voice acting. Every character has a good unique voice.
2. Well optimized graphics.

- Horrible map design which favors defending teams allowing them to hold choke points directly outside of their base easily while attacking teams have to run 10+ seconds back from a spawn point after waiting 6 seconds to respawn. Additionally, defending teams get a 60 second head start which allows them to easily camp the initial attacking team's base with impunity.

I give Overwatch a 10/10 rating not because I believe it is perfect, or because it has everything that I could possibly want it to have. I give it that rating because I give it my highest recommendation. I think if you enjoy arena shooters, it's virtually guaranteed that you will enjoy and get your money's worth out of playing  Overwatch. And if you don't enjoy arena shooters... you might still love Overwatch. It's a game of superlative quality, and any criticisms you can level at it simply will not change that brute fact.

Although I see where a lot of the criticisms of the game are coming from, I think they're mostly off-base.

People say the game is ""incomplete."" This is true in the sense that it is in active development. I do not feel that it is true in the sense that the game lacks sufficient features or content to provide a full, satisfactory experience for the majority of players who try it.

People say that the game is derivative -- most commonly, they say that it is derivative of TF2. This is true to a limited extent, but does not constitute a substantive criticism. Team Fortress 2 is about a decade old now -- it is high time we've seen a modern iteration on the concept. Further, Overwatch is highly distinct from TF2 in the way it plays, not to mention the way it looks.

People criticize the game on its business model -- saying that it should be F2P, or that it should be less expensive, or that it should not feature microtransactions. While I have some quibbles myself with the microtransaction system (I refuse to pay real money to gamble for digital goods), I think the business model is generally a healthy, pro-consumer one that will facilitate active development of the game without bleeding customers dry.

Ultimately, you're paying $40 for a multiplayer game that is tons of fun for 100+ hours or easily more, and which is in active development. You can pay more for cosmetic features, but unlocking a fair number of the cosmetics that you want through gameplay is only a moderate grind by, say, F2P standards. Having a progression system that people have some incentive to care about even if they are not serious try-hard players, but which does not affect gameplay is likely good for the long-term health of the game -- as fun as it is, having something to work towards is compelling and satisfying.

The game is not flawless, but criticisms of the game's value proposition strike me as misguided. You can ask for a perfectly polished $40 game with 30+ heroes, 20+ maps, a single player campaign, tons of great cosmetics out of the box, no microtransactions, ongoing support and a robust competitive scene... or you could live in reality and appreciate that as far as value for your money goes, it doesn't get much better than Overwatch.… Expand"

Its basically play the tutorial and then jump into the action…
There are 21 unique feeling characters all separated into 4 different classes, offense, defense, tank and support.. so you can contribute to your team in any way you please whether that’s getting kills, being a shield, or healing
Some classes do have more character variety than the other.. but every last character has its own weapon and special abilities with cool downs, so youre guaranteed to find one to match your playstyle, and hopefully youll find at least 1 in each class for whatever each situation calls for, as you can switch characters during the match much like a gun loadout in other competitive multiplayer shooters
so if youre not feeling one, go down the list until you find your right fit..
All of this is great,, every character feels useful in their own way..
The only problem is theres not much here
There are 12 maps here which is a decent amount of variety, but none stood out to me…
I can easily name maps in other shooters that are fun to just run around and kill people in..
But I couldn’t here.. they all really feel the same…
And evry mission is just objective based…
You have capture.. escort…and control…
Basically youre either fighting or defending a section of the map at all times…
I understand that these are really the only kind of missions that make sense in a game thats about character variety…
But I’d like to see some innovation beyond just the characters…
Maybe coming up with modes for each individual classes, such as a team death match for offense and tanks only
a tower defense for the defense and support team…
get creative
Not just the same modes in every other shooter set inside pretty average maps…
After you’ve put your hours into the game youll level up which unlocks a loot box…
And inside of these loot boxes are garbage taunts, costumes, and sprays…
You grind to looks different while you do the same thing for hours on end.
Which honestly I wouldn’t mind all too much if there was more gameplay variety

Playing a little over 20, the first 10 - 13 were glorious, then it quickly turned ""monotonous"". Polished fun and addicting gameplay can only be fun and addicting as long is it keeps itself fresh, but sadly, overwatch does not have the feet to stand on a justifiable price of 40$, or 60$, if you are playing on console. I don't play on console myself, but its simply insulting for blizzard to make console players pay larger amounts of money for the same content. Not to mention there is a 60$ version for pc as well, which includes some skins, emotes, voicelines, and some small bonuses like a hearthstone card back. By buying this special edition you are paying 20 dollars extra for what I believe to be non substantial rewards. Overwatch suffers in many of the same ways evolve does, granted overwatch is better than evolve but they still share the problem of value. Neither has a campaign or single player, overwatch has 3 modes with one of them essential being a combination of the other two, spanning across a grand total of 11 maps (may be wrong on the maps but thats coming from memory). Blizzard and it's fans are claiming the game to be worth because of its upcoming content, but Blizzard has done nothing but promise future conent. the only future content that we have heard any details of is the upcoming competitive mode (which should already be in the game). The lack of content has often been explained by Blizzard saying that all the dev time went into polishing the game, but I don't buy that, considering the game is not balanced on any  level of play. I've said a lot of bad things about this game but its really not a bad game. It feels like an early beta game, but the graphics and gameplay are fun. The fact of the matter is, I'm already bored, and this doesn't have the legs to be a decade lasting game like Team fortress 2 was. There is a reason tf2 has had an active player base for about a decade now, because its its smart business model, its variety of modes and playstyles, and custom servers. Overwatch has none of these (excluding variety of playstyles), and I think the game will die down eventually unless blizzard either decreases the price of the game or puts all of its effort into seriously pumping out new content for this game.… Expand"

This game is GREAT, but after playing for 2 days I had to return it. There is such little content it's enraging and the money-grabbing micro-transactions are so infuriating it's not worth playing another 10 hours to try n' level up for one more crate. The amount of items you do get is limited to around only 50 per character which makes you feel like very few people were actually creating for the game. Also after researching found out multiple companies were paid to give favorable reviews rather than spending their money on content for the game (the huge problem with it).

I don't usually review games, but I felt like this defiantly deserved one, feeling more like a scam than an proper video game title.

Game play:
There's virtually nothing I can say about the flawless game play and amazing graphics/art style. But, there's more than enough money-grabbing politics and micro transactions that taint the game entirely and make it feel more like a free-to-play title.

Story:
There's no campaign, very intresting story video's online, but they're even present in the game itself.

Offline play:
There's virtually zero online play meaning in a couple years when the game developers stop patching and shut the game down your game will be worth $0 and never be able to be played again.

Price: $60 for consoles, $40 for consoles, although console contracts have agreed to do extremely cheap or virtually free patching for games as of 2015, meaning they're doing you in the butt cause they think you're a stupid ""console gamer.""

Split-screen:
There is none. You do have training though, which takes roughly 10 minutes to complete both (combined) so there's that....

Overall: Gets old quick, really fun though, can see people playing it for years if they update it with a new champ every other month like League and new game modes, but I doubt this will happen and with the $60 price tag it's extremely overrated, oh and the fact they literally paid game companies like Machinima to give them positive reviews so there's that.… Expand"

While the heroes are vast in number, every hero only has one set of weapons, and you cannot change them out with different ones made for your hero. This makes gameplay feel linear, and you can only do what the game makers intended. It's basically a competition on who can left-click faster.

The main thing I am upset about is the attention this game is getting. At the time of this review, Overwatch has about 9 million players playing it, while TF2, the much better game, is left with 47,000.

In conclusion, please, do NOT spend $59.99 on this game. It's not worth it, considering how incomplete it feels. If you want a way better game like this, try TF2.

The content is ok for now. I assume there will come more maps and heroes in future to keep it interesting.… Expand"
81,ali-s,"Jun 13, 2016",10,in first 3 days it was very hard for me  to play so i didn't enjoy very much but after learning heroes and maps it was the most fun game i ever played. its just great  and definitely worth 40 dollars.

83,Molvanian,"Jun 13, 2016",0,"There's a good game buried in Overwatch, but it is grossly overshadowed by one of the worst match making mechanics around. Enforcing a 50% win rate, you will have frustrating, boring match after frustrating, boring match. Even if, somehow, you get a decent one, a rarity, the lack of maps will quickly make this game a dull use of forty dollars."

Pros:

Cons:
☼  The gameplay has nothing to do with the story.  Nothing you do actually takes place in the game's lore.  At all.  All lore is explained outside of the game.
☼  Although the game FEELS responsive, the truth is that the game runs on a 'favor the shooter' system with a low tickrate.  What this means is, if someone shoots you on their screen, it will register as hit even if you were not where they shot you based on your screen.  Think Planetside 1.
☼  The game is -extremely- frustrating.  You will stick to a 50% winrate give or take 5%.  You will get placed in unwinnable matches, you will get placed in matches where your team dominates.  You will sacrifice playing your favorite character often because other people will not play characters/roles required or will pick characters/roles not suitable for the match.

Overall, Overwatch may be a better experience if you have 6 people to play with, or at least 1 person to queue up with, but ultimately for most of us, I think, the game is just a very frustrating game.  I was hoping for better from Blizzard, but if you're prone to getting upset over games (which I am not, but man...) this is a game to avoid.  Like I said, you will get forced to play something you do not want to play, you will try your hardest, and yet even so you will still lose.  You will still encounter people who refuse to do something for the team, you will find people who pick characters that are not suitable for the match, and on top of that the playerbase is extremely hostile.

If you want to play Overwatch, you have to be mentally prepared that you will not own, you will not get to play what you want to play, and you will get called names/get hate directed towards you.  You really need mental fortitude for this game otherwise you will rage and just feel like crap.… Expand"
85,riseandfall,"Jun 12, 2016",10,Easy to learn super difficult to master. I just want to keep playing - which speaks to the game play. I play the game because it's fun plain and simple - not because of rewards or progression - just because the core of the game is amazing.

-it wants to be casual to appeal to a greater oudience but wants to be esport using very restricetd game modes,with very resitricted games settings
-it wants to be focused on characterization and lore but it shoots itself in the foot via being an competitive fps
